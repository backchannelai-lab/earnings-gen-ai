# üîç Anomaly Detection & Trend Validation System

## Overview

The EarningsGen AI system now includes comprehensive anomaly detection and trend validation capabilities that automatically identify unusual financial metrics and significant changes requiring verification. This system addresses the critical need for real-time validation of financial data in earnings communications.

## üö® What Gets Detected

### Critical Anomalies
- **MLR of 2.1%**: Immediately flagged as unusually low for health insurance (expected: 75-90%)
- **Efficiency Ratio of 15.2%**: Flagged as critically low for banking (expected: 50-70%)
- **Revenue Growth of 182.1%**: Flagged as dramatic change requiring immediate verification

### Warning Ranges
- **MLR of 95.2%**: Outside normal range but within acceptable limits
- **Net Interest Margin of 5.2%**: Above normal range but within acceptable limits

### Trend Deviations
- **100+ percentage point changes**: Automatically flagged as dramatic shifts
- **Quarter-over-quarter changes**: Tracked and categorized by magnitude
- **Cross-document consistency**: Validated against historical baselines

## üè≠ Industry-Specific Validation Rules

### Health Insurance
```javascript
'MLR': {
    normalRange: { min: 75, max: 90 },
    warningRange: { min: 70, max: 95 },
    criticalRange: { min: 0, max: 100 },
    unit: '%',
    description: 'Medical Loss Ratio',
    explanation: 'MLR represents the percentage of premium revenue spent on medical claims and quality improvement activities. Typical range is 75-90% for health insurers.'
}
```

### Banking
```javascript
'Efficiency_Ratio': {
    normalRange: { min: 50, max: 70 },
    warningRange: { min: 45, max: 75 },
    criticalRange: { min: 0, max: 100 },
    unit: '%',
    description: 'Efficiency Ratio',
    explanation: 'Measures non-interest expenses as a percentage of revenue. Lower is better, typical range is 50-70%.'
}
```

### General Metrics
```javascript
'Revenue_Growth': {
    normalRange: { min: -10, max: 30 },
    warningRange: { min: -20, max: 50 },
    criticalRange: { min: -50, max: 100 },
    unit: '%',
    description: 'Revenue Growth',
    explanation: 'Year-over-year revenue growth rate. Typical range varies by industry and economic conditions.'
}
```

## üìä Change Magnitude Thresholds

| Category | Threshold | Action Required |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Minor** | < 5% | Monitor for trends |
| **Moderate** | 5-15% | Standard review |
| **Significant** | 15-30% | Additional explanation needed |
| **Dramatic** | > 50% | Immediate verification required |

## üîß How to Use

### 1. Automatic Detection
The system automatically analyzes any text you select in the editor:
- Select text containing financial metrics
- Click "üîç Anomaly Detection" button
- Review validation results and trend analysis

### 2. Manual Testing
Use the test function in browser console:
```javascript
// Test with specific text
window.testAnomalyDetection("MLR improved to 2.1% this quarter");

// Test with default example
window.testAnomalyDetection();
```

### 3. Enhanced Context Analysis
Combine RAG analysis with anomaly detection:
```javascript
// Run both analyses
await window.simpleAI.enhancedContextAnalysis(selectedText);
```

## üìà Historical Baseline Establishment

### Automatic Learning
- **First encounter**: Establishes baseline for future comparison
- **Subsequent updates**: Tracks changes and identifies trends
- **Persistent storage**: Maintains data across browser sessions

### Baseline Example
```javascript
{
    "health_insurance_MLR": {
        "value": 82.1,
        "metricType": "MLR",
        "industry": "health_insurance",
        "context": "Medical loss ratio was 82.1% for Q3...",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
        "updateCount": 3
    }
}
```

## üéØ Detection Examples

### Example 1: Critical MLR Anomaly
**Input**: "The company's medical loss ratio was 2.1% for Q3"

**Output**:
```
üö® Critical Anomaly Detected:
‚Ä¢ MLR: 2.1%
‚Ä¢ Issue: 2.1% is significantly outside expected range
‚Ä¢ Expected: MLR should be 75-90% for health insurers
‚Ä¢ Action: Requires immediate verification against source documents
```

### Example 2: Dramatic Trend Change
**Input**: "MLR improved from 83.2% to 2.1%"

**Output**:
```
üîç Trend Deviation Detected:
‚Ä¢ MLR: 2.1% (baseline: 83.2%)
‚Ä¢ Change: -81.1 percentage points (-97.5%)
‚Ä¢ Magnitude: Dramatic change requiring immediate verification
‚Ä¢ Action: Cross-check with source documents and business justification
```

### Example 3: Normal Range
**Input**: "Medical loss ratio was 82.1% for Q3"

**Output**:
```
‚úÖ Validation Passed:
‚Ä¢ MLR: 82.1%
‚Ä¢ Status: Within normal range (75-90%)
‚Ä¢ Trend: No significant changes detected
‚Ä¢ Action: No verification required
```

### For Developers
- **Extend rules**: Add industry-specific validation criteria
- **Customize thresholds**: Adjust sensitivity based on use case
- **Monitor performance**: Track detection accuracy and false positives
- **User feedback**: Incorporate user corrections into baseline updates

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- **Local Processing**: All analysis performed in browser
- **No External Storage**: Metrics never sent to external servers
- **User Control**: Full control over data export and deletion
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of validation decisions

### Compliance
- **Regulatory Awareness**: Built-in knowledge of industry standards
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive audit trail for compliance reviews
- **Verification Support**: Tools to support regulatory requirements

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No metrics detected**: Ensure text contains recognizable financial patterns
2. **False positives**: Adjust validation rules or thresholds as needed
