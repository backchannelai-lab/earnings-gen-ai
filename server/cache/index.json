I   will   now turn the  conference over to the   chairman and   chief executive officer of UnitedHealth  Group,   Stephen Hemsley .  Ste phen   Hemsley  Thank you.   Good morning   a nd t hank you for joining. Today our prepared remarks  will be a little longer than usual   so we will be allowing more time for your  questions.  As we begin, I want to recognize   our employees who have been so dedicated to  serving our patients, consumers and customers during a prolonged, challenging  period for our business. And I’d like to thank our leadership team, many of whom  are new in their roles, for their willingness to join me in looking hard at our\nbusinesses, getting a grounded assessment of our action plans, re - baselining our  outlook and moving apace to advance the performance of each of our  businesses.  This morning, I know you are eager to get into the underlying details of our  revised financial outlook, which we will do. But at this moment, I believe it ’s   also  important to convey the tone we are setting at this enterprise.  More than anything, it is a tone of change and reform born out of a recommitment  to our mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system  work better for everyone. It ’s   a mission that requires a commitment to a culture of  values, of service, responsibility, integrity and humility.  We pair that mission - driven ambition of reform with a keen sense of the  opportunity and the expectation to perform better than we ever have. As we  continue to assess the state of our businesses, it is very apparent that some  require a fundamental reorientation, others require building and nurturing, and  others must be   re considered and   re directed to original purpose. We also  recognize the need and the opportunity to revisit and address critical processes  and fundamental business practices, both internal and market - facing. We are  acutely aware we have an enormous responsibility for providing care   for   million s  of   people and for protecting the government and private programs we partner in.  As such we have embarked on a real cultural shift in our relationships with  regulators and all external stakeholders. We intend to be proactively engaged,  constructive and responsive to the concerns of all stakeholders and in our  engagement with them.  We have the chance to reposition our enterprise as a far more modern, reliable,  consumer and provider friendly enterprise using new technologies and  approaches, and we are going to pursue that course.  Pursuit of these opportunities aligns to and enables our reform and change  mandate and allows us to better achieve our mission and to steadily perform  better in doing so.\nWe are on this course against a challenging environment which includes:  •   A generational pullback in Medicare funding, set in motion in 2023 and  playing out through 2026.  •   Unprecedented medical cost trend , measured in both intensity of services  used as well as unit prices and more aggressive care provider coding and  billing technologies.  •   The prospects for further contraction of the Medicaid and Exchange  markets.  •   The growing need to invest in the opportunities new technologies offer and  the expectation of all health care entities to offer a better experience for  consumers, customers, care providers and employees.  •   And finally, the continuing public controversy over long - standing practices  and complexities across the entire health care sector,   particularly  managed care , which bears the critical roles for coverage, for care  management and for pricing for the intensity and the cost of services used  into the benefit products and programs for the entire health care market.  As a leading provider of health services, we must help advance a better  health system.  We are committed to engaging in these pursuits with a sense of purpose and  better partnership with all stakeholders, transparency in our business and  reporting practices and continued integrity in all we do.  Beyond the environmental factors that are affecting the entire sector and more  specifically to us, we have made pricing and operational mistakes a s   well as  others . They are getting the needed attention.   Our critical processes, including  risk status, care management, pharmaceutical services and others are being  reviewed by independent experts and they will be reviewed every year and  reported on. And these processes can be reviewed at any time by outside  stakeholders. While we believe in   our   oversight and the integrity of these  processes, wherever they are determined to be at variance with prescribed  practice, they will be promptly remediated and we ’ ll continue on this path.\nAll the foregoing   is   fully addressable. We can steadily restore our performance to  levels consistent with our mission and stakeholder expectations   –   all as we  strengthen an institutional culture aligned to that mission   and accountable for  performance  Over the last 60 days or more, we have made extensive management and  operational changes aligned to this agenda of reform and performance. Other  such changes   –  •   to   leadership,  •   to our businesses, our culture, approaches and practices,  •   and to our board, governance and succession oversight, as appropriate,  •   will continue to be made as we proceed through this period.  With those thoughts in mind, Tim Noel and Patrick Conway, heads of  UnitedHealthcare and Optum respectively, will walk through some of the  specifics in their businesses. John Rex will discuss financial performance and the  elements affecting our outlook.   A nd   I’ll come back with some closing thoughts,  and then we will have ample time for questions and answers.   Tim.  Tim Noel  Thanks, Ste phen .  I want to start by emphasizing that we are approaching our business with greater  humility, greater transparency, and a renewed determination to meet your  expectations and our standards.  The primary driver of the UnitedHealthcare earnings shortfall for 2025 is that our  pricing assumptions were well - short of actual medical costs.   Our current view for  2025 reflects $6.5   billion   more in medical costs than we anticipated in our initial  outlook.\nA little over half, or $3.6   billion ,   of this is in our broad - based Medicare portfolio.  About one - third, or $2.3   billion , is in the commercial business, split evenly  between ACA plans and our employer business. The remaining trend pressure is  related to Medicaid, most notably due to elevated behavioral trend.  In addition to trend - driven issues, the updated 2025 outlook removes about $1  billion from previously planned portfolio actions that we are no longer pursuing.  It also reflects about $850   million   of other items including unfavorable prior period  items   –   primarily from 2024   –   and recognition of several one - time settlements.  We know these are serious challenges.   We are humbled by them and will carry  that sense of humility more deeply into our culture.   But we also believe we can  resolve our current issues and recapture our earnings growth potential.  Let me now provide an update on   where each business stands,   starting with  Medicare .  When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half  of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did  not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are  now experiencing. This was compounded by the magnitude of plan exits across  the sector and the extent to which we now see care providers placing further  service intensity into the health system.   The increasingly flexible orientation to  which our Medicare networks and plan designs have evolved over recent years  left us less able to address these trends in - year.  On trend specifically, the increase in care activity across Individual and Group  Medicare Advantage we saw earlier this year has now affected   complex  populations and our Medicare Supplement business as well.  Across Medicare Advantage, physician and outpatient care together represent  70 %   of the pressure year to date; however, inpatient utilization has accelerated  through Q2 and we expect will comprise a relatively larger portion of the pressure  over the full year.\nWe continue to see utilization increases in ER and observation stays, and  consistently see more services being offered and bundled as part of each ER  visit and clinical encounter.  In short: most encounters are intensifying in services and costing more. Th e  higher trend is broad - based geographically and across our membership,  including our large retained membership base.  To put this into context, we had initially assumed Medicare Advantage medical  cost trend of just over 5 %   when configuring our 2025 bids, in line with our  normalized trend experience in 2024. We now expect full year 2025 trend to be  approximately 7.5 % .  Medicare Supplement, which typically is representative of overall care activity  levels and cost trends in Medicare fee for service broadly, is up similarly in 2025  compared to historical levels. We expect that trend to be over 11% this year vs. 8  to 9% in recent years   --   further confirming the broad - based nature of the care  activity,   and   the coding and billing patterns trends we are seeing.  On Commercial :   We are seeing higher - than - expected medical cost increases,  particularly in outpatient care and, although to a lesser extent, inpatient care.  Orthopedic spending and pharmacy infusions are notable factors here. In the  ACA business, the revenue impact resulting from a difference between the  morbidity that we priced for and what we experienced is the primary cause of our  underperformance.  One example of the elevated Commercial trend is group fully - insured.   There,  trend is approaching 11%, which is approximately 100bps higher than our initial  expectations.  Moving to Medicaid …Similar elevated trends are apparent and are further  affected by increasing and unanticipated acceleration of costs in behavioral  health, where trend is running at 20 % , as well as in pharmacy and home health.\nWe anticipate the existing rate and acuity mismatch will extend well into next  year.  Beyond these segment - specific factors, there are other broad drivers of higher  medical costs. There has been a marked increase in health care costs due in  part to increases in service intensity per encounter. For example, in Medicare  Advantage, higher frequency of physician rounding, testing and related services  of specialists and in ER settings are contributing to elevated outpatient spend.  In addition to strongly responsive pricing for 2026, which I will speak to in a  moment, we are intensifying our remediation actions.  We have stepped up our audit, clinical policy and payment integrity tools to  protect customers and patients from unnecessary costs. These efforts ensure  care is delivered in appropriate settings and grounded in safety and quality while  also identifying waste and abuse in outlier coding and billing practices. We are  shifting to narrower networks and focusing on more disciplined managed  products, particularly in Medicare Advantage. And we have scaled our AI efforts  across health plan operations, which improves the patient and provider service  experiences while driving cost savings.  Lastly, in Medicaid , we continue to actively engage with state partners, using  both past experience and data - driven insights to show the need for immediate  and more regular rate updates.  Taken together, this work is helping restore our operational muscle and  reclaiming executional rigor, helped by modern tools and driven by relentless  focus on improvement.  Turning now to 2026 …Our pricing strategy is intensely focused on margin  recovery and moving back toward our earnings growth targets.  In Medicare , we have historically targeted an operating margin range of 3 to 5 %   .  Now, with the changes from the Inflation Reduction Act on the Part D program,\nwhich resulted in higher revenue, but do not impact earnings, the equivalent  target margin range is in the 2 to 4 %   range.  We are working intensively to remediate Medicare through pricing, product  design and benefit changes that will enable us to be within the lower half of the  targeted margin ranges in 2026, and advancing further in 2027.  Our Medicare Advantage pricing strategy for 2026 assumes a trend approaching  10 % , compared to our current 7.5 %   trend expectation. This accounts for trend  acceleration and incorporates factors such as changes in fee schedules and the  continuation of higher yields from provider coding and billing practices.  Considering the continued cost trend and funding pressures, and the need to  support margin recovery, we have made significant adjustments to benefits.  Additionally   –   and unfortunately   –   given these pressures we have made the  difficult decision to exit plans that currently serve over 600,000 members,  primarily in less managed products such as PPO offerings. We have taken  similar approaches for Medicare Supplement, Group MA, and standalone Part D  pricing for next year. We will be watching the market closely as the 2026  Medicare offerings become public so we can better assess our market  positioning and respond quickly.  For Commercial , because renewals occur over the course of the year, we are  able to price for changes more dynamically.   Our pricing will anticipate high er  trend continuing into 2026 and 2027.   We expect increased membership decline,  as well as shifts into both level - funded and self - funded product categories,  because of higher medical cost trends.  In the individual exchange business, while we are prepared to continue to  participate in the majority of the 30 markets we currently serve, we will approach  them far more conservatively for 2026. We may need to make the difficult  decision to exit select markets if we are unable to achieve the rates necessary for  higher market - wide morbidity. Additionally, due to the projected expiration of  premium subsidies across the ACA market our membership should decline\nsignificantly and we are mindful of the potential for adverse selection dynamics  as we re - price these offerings for next year.  In Medicaid , there remains a lag between funding levels and member health risk  and we expect this to continue into 2026, resulting in additional margin  compression in th e   business including a loss within the non - dual segment of  Medicaid in 2026.   Membership losses from early adoption of recent legislation is  also factored into our initial views for 2026. Wherever states support responsible  funding for Medicaid, we remain committed to serving people through that  program and view this as integral to our mission.  The American health system’s long - standing cost problem is accelerating. We  are embracing our responsibility to continue to drive better health outcomes while  trying to keep health care affordable for all Americans.  The operational and pricing strategies I have described reflect our understanding  of the challenges we face as a company and a society, and our dedication to  responsibly navigating the current financial pressures so that we can set a stable  course for the future.  I’ll now turn it over to Patrick Conway, CEO of Optum.  Patrick Conway  Thanks ,   Tim.  Clearly, Optum’s performance this year has also not met expectations   –   yours or  ours. Echoing Tim and Steve, we are approaching this with humility and the need  for deep analysis of key issues, and commitment to substantially improved  execution. Serving our patients and customers is at the heart of our mission and  business and we have the opportunity to truly help make the health system better  for everyone.\nTo do that, we need to refocus on our performance discipline with a bias for  action and transparency for all stakeholders.  We have launched our agenda of change at Optum, starting with the evolution of  our leadership team.   Roger Connor brings tremendous experience in  organizational execution as our chief financial officer. Krista Nelson is a deeply  experienced health care operator now in the new role of chief operating officer of  Optum Health. Dhivya Suryadevara is already reenergizing product development,  marketing and service as the new CEO of Optum Insight. And Jon Mahrt brings  his unmatched pharmacy services experience to bolster the already compelling  offerings of Optum Rx.  These are not the only people in new roles and there will be more. We are taking  these and many other steps swiftly to enable Optum to recapture its historic  momentum.  Let me turn now to a review of our businesses, starting with Optum Health   –  where improved execution is needed most and where we are experiencing the  greatest pressures to our business.  Our belief remains steadfast: value - based care has the potential to transform  health   care. Yet even as we struggle to align this model with new funding  dynamics, it consistently delivers better outcomes. Tim highlighted the  challenges of rising health care unit costs, accelerating service volumes and  provider coding intensity, which further underscores that value - based care  remains the most effective method for compensating providers to improve and  sustain a patient’s health in contrast to simply increasing the volume and prices  of services.  Research consistently supports this premise, showing Medicare Advantage  patients in fully accountable arrangements are 20% less likely to be hospitalized  and experience 11% fewer ER visits compared to those in fee - for - service. We  are early in our value - based care journey. We know we have real and self -\ninflicted executional challenges and we bear the responsibility to get this right,  recognizing that urgent work lies ahead.  We have spent a decade assembling a care delivery model today serving nearly  20 million patients across three lines of business   –   value - based care, fee - for -  service care delivery and services, the latter two of which help further enable  value - based care.  The first category, value - based care, has grown to account for approximately  65% of Optum Health’s revenues   and serves 5 million patients in fully  accountable arrangements. I’ll provide more details on this in a moment but first  will detail the gap to our original Optum Health outlook.  Overall, Optum Health earnings in 2025 are approximately $6.6   billion   below our  expectations. To break this down:  •   Approximately $3.6   billion , or 55%, is concentrated in our value - based  care business with three principal drivers of roughly equal weight:  o   1 :   The mix of enrollment, including more complex and dually eligible  members, and more new - to - Optum patients who were  underserved;  o   2 :   Accelerated medical trend, particularly physician and outpatient  in Medicare and behavioral in Medicaid.  o   And   3 :   Under - estimation of new members’ risk status as they come  into our care and sub - optimal execution of the V28 risk model  transition;  •   Second category   -   Another $2   billion , or 30%, relates to the decision to  discontinue previously planned portfolio actions.  •   And about $1   billion , or 15%, is from a combination of lower service  volumes in our services businesses, some non - recurring prior period  impacts and the slowing of tuck - in acquisitions. For example, on lower  service volumes, in 2025 we planned for   approximately   20 million fee - for -\nservice visits in our care delivery clinics and we are tracking 19 million  visits, or 5% below this expecta tion Let me dive a bit deeper specifically  into factors affecting our value - based care business:  •   First, V28. This industry - wide shift is effectively a price reduction that we  now estimate created an $11   bill ion   headwind over three years for Optum  Health, with ~$7   billion   that will be realized through 2025. That is $2 billion  and $1 billion, respectively, more than our initial estimates while we also  overestimated the impact and mis - executed the planned efforts to offset  the V28 funding cuts.  •   Second, enrollment mix. Consistent with Q1, in 2025 we have an  unanticipated number of new - to - Optum Health patients who were  previously underserved. These new patients are largely in markets where  numerous plan exits occurred. They include complex patients who require  time to be managed effectively by us. This mix impact implies negative  margins near double - digits for these new patients, which will improve  meaningfully in 2026.  •   Lastly, the elevated medical trend we recognized in the second quarter  was exacerbated by insufficient pricing within United Healthcare and other  payer partners pulling through in the form of insufficient capitation rates for  Optum.  Despite these headwinds, Optum ’s fully accountable value - based care business  is delivering an operating margin of about 1% in 2025. This compares to full year  operating margins of over 3% in 2024 and nearly 5% in 2023.  A large part of the mis - execution in addressing the V28 funding cuts was due to a  non - standardized and overly localized management approach which we are  addressing with urgency. We are driving to a consistent and much more  concentrated regional operating model with four market leaders. We are  evaluating our position in each market. We will shift risk back to the original  underwriters until we have the hardened capacity to navigate it under value -\nbased   constructs.  And Optum will be much more disciplined in taking risk arrangements in product  designs and constructs that allow value - based care to have its intended impact.  Th e   margin compression reflects significant growth in new membership cohorts   –  with nearly 40% of the patients served today having come in since the beginning  of 2024. It also reflects the pull - through from   Medicare Advantage pricing  dislocation Tim described, and the V28 payment cuts.  Regarding patient cohorts: in our value - based care practices, margins improve  the longer patients remain. Our most mature value - based care cohorts   –   those  from 2021 and prior   –   are operating at an estimated 8%+ margin in 2025.   Those  in   2022   and   2023 cohorts are operating at a 2% margin; the 2024 through 2025  groups are at negative margins.  Strong physician engagement, appropriate medical diagnosis, and improved,  consistent quality of care continues to drive year over year improvement in a  cohort’s financial performance and in their health. But it ’ s taking too long and  there is too much variability in results among practices, and we are actively  addressing those factors.  That’s the overall picture of what is happening. I’ll turn now to remediation. Our  plan for improvement has four key elements:  First and foremost, we are improving the implementation and consistency of our  clinical model, which is anchored in primary care and supported by wraparound  services that continue to outperform on quality and cost.  Second, we are committed to margin recovery in value - based care.   We’ve  aligned our 2026 benefits and product portfolio and footprint with our payor  partners to address the final year of V28 headwinds. We plan to cease  arrangements for about 200,000 patients largely in fully accountable PPO\nproducts, representing approximately 40% of the PPO patients we serve today.  We expect to keep narrowing our exposure beyond 2026.  We are increasing rates to reflect the higher risk profiles and acuity we are  seeing and expect to continue. We believe the combination of these activities will  mitigate about half of the remaining $4 billion V28 headwind in 2026.   The  remainder of our offset will come from operating cost discipline and consistent  execution of our care programs which enhance engagement, diagnosis accuracy  and quality outcomes, and reduce overall cost of care.  With 2026 being the final year of   V 28 phase - in, you should expect 2026 value -  based care margins to remain relatively consistent with the 1% margin we are  achieving this year, and then begin to advance again in 2027 and beyond.  We are optimizing our portfolio of clinical practices. We are managing our fee - for -  service and fully accountable risk practices to align with performance  expectations, transitioning to partial risk or service arrangements where  necessary, and exiting fully accountable products in certain markets.  Third, we are aggressively advancing operational disciplines across our portfolio  of businesses. The more concentrated operating model I mentioned earlier plays  into more standardized approaches, predictable outcomes and lower operating  costs. We will complete the final stages of our technology integration, which will  enable meaningful advances with emerging technologies like AI to drive  efficiency gains. For 2026 we expect to deliver almost $1   billion   in cost  reductions.  Finally, beyond value - based care, Optum Health also includes fee - for - service  care delivery, including home care, ambulatory surgical care and medical  practices that are not yet fully accountable but support value - based care.   These  together account for 15% of Optum Health’s revenues. Most of these businesses  are performing well and operate at low double - digit margins. However, the  primary care and multi - specialty medical practices that are not yet fully  accountable are running at   negative margins   –   generating hundreds of millions of\nlosses this year alone   –   placing the overall fee - for - service care delivery business  in the mid - single digit margin range.  So, we are actively working to improve payment yields and productivity while  growing these high - value services and fee - for - service margins. We are targeting  growth for these services which are projected to deliver strong year - over - year  earnings growth in 2026.  The third component of Optum Health   –   services   –   is comprised of businesses  including managed behavioral health, military and veterans and health financial  services. These account for about 20% of Optum Health revenues and combined  have   an   almost 10% operating margins.  Overall at Optum Health, while we expect continued pressure for the rest of this  year, we anticipate meaningful improvement in our operations and with earnings  growth in 2026, albeit with a longer path to recovery in our value - based care  business. We now see Optum Health long - term margins in the 6 - 8% range, and  at about 5% for value - based care specifically, as we see significant growth  opportunity for the decade to come.   The overall blended margin will reflect the  early year investment losses generated by new cohorts.   Optum Health is early in  its development and mis - execution is a clear setback, but the long - term growth  potential and expectations remain intact   and significant .  Moving to Optum Insight   –   there is a great need and appetite for technology and  data products to help the health system perform more efficiently and effectively  yet Optum Insight has not fully capitalized on this opportunity. That’s largely due  to an unfocused suite of products, lagging innovation, and longer than expected  impact from last year’s cyberattack, which, unfortunately, came at the expense of  being able to drill down on business innovation, operations and growth.  But as I mentioned earlier, we have a talented team in place now and continue to  recruit talent to develop the next generation of products rooted in AI.\nAs it relates specifically to 2025, we are adjusting our outlook downward by $1  billion .   About half of this is due to a more gradual recovery than initially expected  in some of our volume - based businesses due to Change Healthcare and one -  time cyber - related expenses.  The other half is due to pausing previously planned portfolio actions so that we  can prioritize growth and innovation across our broader portfolio.  At Optum Rx, client retention remains high and consistent with past years. We  expect revenue growth of $18 billion, or 13%, and earnings growth of just over  $200   million , or nearly 4%, driven by low - margin specialty drugs.  Compared to the strong revenue growth rate, our earnings growth has been  constrained by four main factors: the removal of portfolio actions from our plan is  a roughly $150   million   headwind; another $50   million   is from a couple of   ancillary  businesses, where we are taking aggressive corrective actions and adjusting  plans; and the impact of the initial launch phase of our private label business,  Nuvaila,   is   a roughly $150   million   headwind. As it matures, we see Nuvaila  delivering affordability for clients and consumers and strong earnings for Optum  Rx.  Additionally, GLP1s, wh ich can benefit ap propriate patients , continue to impact  earnings, representing a $160   million   headwind for our pharmacy business.  After three months in this role, I want to thank the thousands of people serving in  Optum, and to let external stakeholders know that the problems are fixable, and  that Optum will continue to drive long - term growth and make the most of our  opportunity to serve people.  I’ll turn it over to our president and chief financial officer, John Rex  John?  John Rex  Thanks, Patrick.\nI’ll first walk through second quarter results, then provide some color around the  underlying assumptions within our re - established `25 outlook.  Starting with the second quarter, UnitedHealth Group reported revenues of  nearly $112 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year, which reflected growth  across UnitedHealthcare and Optum.  Adjusted earnings per share of $4.08 was below the same period last year. This  was due primarily to the pricing and medical cost trend factors at  UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health. Included is about $1.2 billion in discrete  items. A little over half reflects the recognition of unfavorable impacts to our ACA  exchange offerings, which I will describe later in more detail. The remainder is  the settlement of several outstanding items which have been in dispute or for  which collection has recently become questionable. Most of these items arise  from prior years. The full year ‘25 outlook we’ve offered today accommodates   $1  billion   in additional potential such items that we may seek to resolve in - year.  Now on to business overviews.  At UnitedHealthcare, second quarter revenues grew by over $12 billion to $86.1  billion, while operating earnings declined by $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion primarily  due to the medical trend factors Tim discussed.  Within our Medicare businesses, year - to - date Medicare Advantage growth is  650,000 people, including those who are dually eligible for Medicaid and  Medicare.  As noted, the second quarter results reflect just over $600 million of unfavorable  impacts from our ACA exchange business, which includes acceleration of  anticipated second half losses with the establishment of a premium deficiency  reserve.   This is due to the higher patient morbidity that is pervasive across the  entire exchange market.\nGiven competitive market dynamics, we have less member growth within our  commercial offerings than initially anticipated. ACA exchange drives about one -  third of our reduced commercial risk member growth outlook for 2025, with  group - insured comprising much of the rest.  As outlined earlier, our Medicaid offerings continue to experience pressure from  the lag in state rate updates relative to the health status of the members being  served. Our state partners remain highly engaged in ongoing rate conversations  and we are closely attuned to   the   federal funding changes and the continued  pace of medical cost trends, particularly in behavioral health.  Moving to Optum.  Optum Health revenues were $25.2 billion in the second quarter, a decline of  $1.8 billion from last year. This was driven by the previously noted contract  adjustments and the effects of the Medicare funding reductions. Optum Health  now expects to add 300,000 new value - based care patients this year compared  to the initial 650,000 outlook as it seeks to focus on improving operating  performance. As noted, we‘ve updated our long - term target margin objective for  Optum Health to the 6 to 8   %   range.  Optum Insight had revenues of $4.8 billion, an increase of $285 million or 6%  year over year. We continue to progress on customer recovery following last  year’s cyber event, albeit pacing more slowly than expected and this is a  component of the reduced full year outlook. The contract revenue backlog at the  end of the second quarter was $32.1 billion.  Optum Rx second quarter revenues grew $6 billion, or 19%, over last year to  $38.5 billion, driven by new customer adds as well as continued contribution from  specialty products. Total adjusted scripts were 414 million compared to 399  million in the year ago quarter.  Moving on to 2025 guidance.\nOur adjusted earnings   outlook is at least $16 per share. Revenues will approach  $448 billion, growth of 11% over ‘24.  We now expect a full - year medical care ratio of 89.25 % , plus or minus 25 basis  points. This compares to the initial 86.5 %   mid - point we offered at the end of last  year, with the increase driven by the factors discussed.  Within this, seasonal pacing compared to historical measures is impacted  somewhat by the Part D coverage gap modifications due to the Inflation  Reduction Act. With first half results, at the midpoint that places the second half  at just under 91.5%, with the fourth quarter expected to be the highest and, at  this distance, a relatively proportionate distribution on either side.  The full year outlook contemplates a total of $1.6 billion of potential settlement  items, an incremental $1 billion over the $600 million recognized in the second  quarter.  Our tax rate for the year is now estimated at about 18.5 % , affected by our  revised earnings outlook as expected benefits remain steady, while earnings  declined. The lower tax expense in the second quarter reflects the year - to - date  recognition of the updated full year effective tax rate. We expect the second half  rate to be just over 20 % .  Full year ’25 cash flows from operations are expected to be about $16 billion or  1.1 times net income.  In June, we increased our dividend by 5% and we will strike a balance as to how  we use capital over the near - term, being thoughtful about maintaining a strong  balance sheet and credit rating and mindful of long - standing commitments,  including the pending Amedisys transaction. Our updated share count of 912 to  914 million compares to the original outlook of 918 to 923 million and considers  only share repurchase s   completed earlier this year.\nWe will continue to balance and assess our capital priorities as we progress to  returning to the performance levels we know we can achieve.  With that, I will hand it back over to St ephen   before we head into Q&A.  Ste phen   Hemsley  Thanks, John.  This is a challenging year for our enterprise. But I feel strongly we can overcome  these challenges   –   as we have done before. I can see the depth of the  commitment of our team. We are regaining the intensity, the precision, and the  execution al   disciplines required to perform consistently   and reliably . Our  customers and our shareholders deserve it. And the health system expects us to  function to our full potential.  As we look toward 2026 and beyond, we expect the efforts we discussed  throughout today’s call to steadily improve our performance.   It begins with  respecting pricing basics, advancing our foresight acumen and just better, more  intense,   more decisive   overall management.  We will be driving better business practices, better consumer and provider  experience, and accelerating investment s   in key areas to both strengthen our  foundations and modernize our business es , anchored in practical innovations  and   scaled AI applications.  We are continuing to evaluate the investments we need to make in the near - term  to meet our long - term growth potential while acknowledging the challenging  environment in the year ahead.  As I mentioned at our shareholder meeting in June, we are rebuilding   the   trust  through both change and through increased transparency. That includes work to  ensure a wide range of stakeholders have confidence in the integrity of our  Company and our business practices.   This work is moving forward   in   our  assessment of key policies, practices and associated processes by the end of\nthe third quarter and our first performance measures report in the fourth quarter.  We have retained independent experts to oversee and assist in these reviews,  including the Analysis Group and FTI Consulting. We will use this to continually  strengthen and advance our strong compliance environment.  Looking to 2026, at this distance I would expect   solid but   moderate earnings  growth. As we look further ahead, we see our earnings growth outlook  strengthening quickly in 2027 and pacing steadily upward over the succeeding  years.\n\n[UNH-Q2-2025-Remarks.pdf]\nEarnings Conference Call  Second   Quarter   202 5   Remarks  July 29 , 202 5  Moderator:  Good morning,   and w elcome to the UnitedHealth Group   Second   Quarter   20 2 5  Earnings Conference Call. A question and answer session will follow  UnitedHealth Group’s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being  recorded.  Here is some important introductory information.   This call contains “forward -  looking” statements   under U.S. federal securities laws.   These statements are  subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ  materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of  some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with  t he Securities   and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements  included in our current and periodic filings.  This call will also reference non - GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non -  GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the “Financial &   Earnings Reports ”  section of the Company’s Investor   Relations   page at  www.unitedhealthgroup.com.  Information presented on this call is contained in the Earnings Release we issued  this morning and in our Form 8 - K dated   July 29 , 202 5 , which may be accessed  from the Investor   Relations   page of the Company’s website. I   will   now turn the  conference over to the   chairman and   chief executive officer of UnitedHealth  Group,   Stephen Hemsley .  Ste phen   Hemsley  Thank you.   Good morning   a nd t hank you for joining. Today our prepared remarks  will be a little longer than usual   so we will be allowing more time for your  questions.  As we begin, I want to recognize   our employees who have been so dedicated to  serving our patients, consumers and customers during a prolonged, challenging  period for our business. And I’d like to thank our leadership team, many of whom  are new in their roles, for their willingness to join me in looking hard at our\nbusinesses, getting a grounded assessment of our action plans, re - baselining our  outlook and moving apace to advance the performance of each of our  businesses.  This morning, I know you are eager to get into the underlying details of our  revised financial outlook, which we will do. But at this moment, I believe it ’s   also  important to convey the tone we are setting at this enterprise.  More than anything, it is a tone of change and reform born out of a recommitment  to our mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system  work better for everyone. It ’s   a mission that requires a commitment to a culture of  values, of service, responsibility, integrity and humility.  We pair that mission - driven ambition of reform with a keen sense of the  opportunity and the expectation to perform better than we ever have. As we  continue to assess the state of our businesses, it is very apparent that some  require a fundamental reorientation, others require building and nurturing, and  others must be   re considered and   re directed to original purpose. We also  recognize the need and the opportunity to revisit and address critical processes  and fundamental business practices, both internal and market - facing. We are  acutely aware we have an enormous responsibility for providing care   for   million s  of   people and for protecting the government and private programs we partner in.  As such we have embarked on a real cultural shift in our relationships with  regulators and all external stakeholders. We intend to be proactively engaged,  constructive and responsive to the concerns of all stakeholders and in our  engagement with them.  We have the chance to reposition our enterprise as a far more modern, reliable,  consumer and provider friendly enterprise using new technologies and  approaches, and we are going to pursue that course.  Pursuit of these opportunities aligns to and enables our reform and change  mandate and allows us to better achieve our mission and to steadily perform  better in doing so.\nWe are on this course against a challenging environment which includes:  •   A generational pullback in Medicare funding, set in motion in 2023 and  playing out through 2026.  •   Unprecedented medical cost trend , measured in both intensity of services  used as well as unit prices and more aggressive care provider coding and  billing technologies.  •   The prospects for further contraction of the Medicaid and Exchange  markets.  •   The growing need to invest in the opportunities new technologies offer and  the expectation of all health care entities to offer a better experience for  consumers, customers, care providers and employees.  •   And finally, the continuing public controversy over long - standing practices  and complexities across the entire health care sector,   particularly  managed care , which bears the critical roles for coverage, for care  management and for pricing for the intensity and the cost of services used  into the benefit products and programs for the entire health care market.  As a leading provider of health services, we must help advance a better  health system.  We are committed to engaging in these pursuits with a sense of purpose and  better partnership with all stakeholders, transparency in our business and  reporting practices and continued integrity in all we do.  Beyond the environmental factors that are affecting the entire sector and more  specifically to us, we have made pricing and operational mistakes a s   well as  others . They are getting the needed attention.   Our critical processes, including  risk status, care management, pharmaceutical services and others are being  reviewed by independent experts and they will be reviewed every year and  reported on. And these processes can be reviewed at any time by outside  stakeholders. While we believe in   our   oversight and the integrity of these  processes, wherever they are determined to be at variance with prescribed  practice, they will be promptly remediated and we ’ ll continue on this path.\nAll the foregoing   is   fully addressable. We can steadily restore our performance to  levels consistent with our mission and stakeholder expectations   –   all as we  strengthen an institutional culture aligned to that mission   and accountable for  performance  Over the last 60 days or more, we have made extensive management and  operational changes aligned to this agenda of reform and performance. Other  such changes   –  •   to   leadership,  •   to our businesses, our culture, approaches and practices,  •   and to our board, governance and succession oversight, as appropriate,  •   will continue to be made as we proceed through this period.  With those thoughts in mind, Tim Noel and Patrick Conway, heads of  UnitedHealthcare and Optum respectively, will walk through some of the  specifics in their businesses. John Rex will discuss financial performance and the  elements affecting our outlook.   A nd   I’ll come back with some closing thoughts,  and then we will have ample time for questions and answers.   Tim.  Tim Noel  Thanks, Ste phen .  I want to start by emphasizing that we are approaching our business with greater  humility, greater transparency, and a renewed determination to meet your  expectations and our standards.  The primary driver of the UnitedHealthcare earnings shortfall for 2025 is that our  pricing assumptions were well - short of actual medical costs.   Our current view for  2025 reflects $6.5   billion   more in medical costs than we anticipated in our initial  outlook.\nA little over half, or $3.6   billion ,   of this is in our broad - based Medicare portfolio.  About one - third, or $2.3   billion , is in the commercial business, split evenly  between ACA plans and our employer business. The remaining trend pressure is  related to Medicaid, most notably due to elevated behavioral trend.  In addition to trend - driven issues, the updated 2025 outlook removes about $1  billion from previously planned portfolio actions that we are no longer pursuing.  It also reflects about $850   million   of other items including unfavorable prior period  items   –   primarily from 2024   –   and recognition of several one - time settlements.  We know these are serious challenges.   We are humbled by them and will carry  that sense of humility more deeply into our culture.   But we also believe we can  resolve our current issues and recapture our earnings growth potential.  Let me now provide an update on   where each business stands,   starting with  Medicare .  When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half  of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did  not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are  now experiencing. This was compounded by the magnitude of plan exits across  the sector and the extent to which we now see care providers placing further  service intensity into the health system.   The increasingly flexible orientation to  which our Medicare networks and plan designs have evolved over recent years  left us less able to address these trends in - year.  On trend specifically, the increase in care activity across Individual and Group  Medicare Advantage we saw earlier this year has now affected   complex  populations and our Medicare Supplement business as well.  Across Medicare Advantage, physician and outpatient care together represent  70 %   of the pressure year to date; however, inpatient utilization has accelerated  through Q2 and we expect will comprise a relatively larger portion of the pressure  over the full year.\nWe continue to see utilization increases in ER and observation stays, and  consistently see more services being offered and bundled as part of each ER  visit and clinical encounter.  In short: most encounters are intensifying in services and costing more. Th e  higher trend is broad - based geographically and across our membership,  including our large retained membership base.  To put this into context, we had initially assumed Medicare Advantage medical  cost trend of just ove...\n\n\nPlease analyze according to the system prompt above.",

In short: most encounters are intensifying in services and costing more. Th e  higher trend is broad - based geographically and across our membership,  including our large retained membership base.  To put this into context, we had initially assumed Medicare Advantage medical  cost trend of just over 5 %   when configuring our 2025 bids, in line with our  normalized trend experience in 2024. We now expect full year 2025 trend to be  approximately 7.5 % .  Medicare Supplement, which typically is representative of overall care activity  levels and cost trends in Medicare fee for service broadly, is up similarly in 2025  compared to historical levels. We expect that trend to be over 11% this year vs. 8  to 9% in recent years   --   further confirming the broad - based nature of the care  activity,   and   the coding and billing patterns trends we are seeing.  On Commercial :   We are seeing higher - than - expected medical cost increases,  particularly in outpatient care and, although to a lesser extent, inpatient care.  Orthopedic spending and pharmacy infusions are notable factors here. In the  ACA business, the revenue impact resulting from a difference between the  morbidity that we priced for and what we experienced is the primary cause of our  underperformance.  One example of the elevated Commercial trend is group fully - insured.   There,  trend is approaching 11%, which is approximately 100bps higher than our initial  expectations.  Moving to Medicaid …Similar elevated trends are apparent and are further  affected by increasing and unanticipated acceleration of costs in behavioral  health, where trend is running at 20 % , as well as in pharmacy and home health.\nWe anticipate the existing rate and acuity mismatch will extend well into next  year.  Beyond these segment - specific factors, there are other broad drivers of higher  medical costs. There has been a marked increase in health care costs due in  part to increases in service intensity per encounter. For example, in Medicare  Advantage, higher frequency of physician rounding, testing and related services  of specialists and in ER settings are contributing to elevated outpatient spend.  In addition to strongly responsive pricing for 2026, which I will speak to in a  moment, we are intensifying our remediation actions.  We have stepped up our audit, clinical policy and payment integrity tools to  protect customers and patients from unnecessary costs. These efforts ensure  care is delivered in appropriate settings and grounded in safety and quality while  also identifying waste and abuse in outlier coding and billing practices. We are  shifting to narrower networks and focusing on more disciplined managed  products, particularly in Medicare Advantage. And we have scaled our AI efforts  across health plan operations, which improves the patient and provider service  experiences while driving cost savings.  Lastly, in Medicaid , we continue to actively engage with state partners, using  both past experience and data - driven insights to show the need for immediate  and more regular rate updates.  Taken together, this work is helping restore our operational muscle and  reclaiming executional rigor, helped by modern tools and driven by relentless  focus on improvement.  Turning now to 2026 …Our pricing strategy is intensely focused on margin  recovery and moving back toward our earnings growth targets.  In Medicare , we have historically targeted an operating margin range of 3 to 5 %   .  Now, with the changes from the Inflation Reduction Act on the Part D program,\nwhich resulted in higher revenue, but do not impact earnings, the equivalent  target margin range is in the 2 to 4 %   range.  We are working intensively to remediate Medicare through pricing, product  design and benefit changes that will enable us to be within the lower half of the  targeted margin ranges in 2026, and advancing further in 2027.  Our Medicare Advantage pricing strategy for 2026 assumes a trend approaching  10 % , compared to our current 7.5 %   trend expectation. This accounts for trend  acceleration and incorporates factors such as changes in fee schedules and the  continuation of higher yields from provider coding and billing practices.  Considering the continued cost trend and funding pressures, and the need to  support margin recovery, we have made significant adjustments to benefits.  Additionally   –   and unfortunately   –   given these pressures we have made the  difficult decision to exit plans that currently serve over 600,000 members,  primarily in less managed products such as PPO offerings. We have taken  similar approaches for Medicare Supplement, Group MA, and standalone Part D  pricing for next year. We will be watching the market closely as the 2026  Medicare offerings become public so we can better assess our market  positioning and respond quickly.  For Commercial , because renewals occur over the course of the year, we are  able to price for changes more dynamically.   Our pricing will anticipate high er  trend continuing into 2026 and 2027.   We expect increased membership decline,  as well as shifts into both level - funded and self - funded product categories,  because of higher medical cost trends.  In the individual exchange business, while we are prepared to continue to  participate in the majority of the 30 markets we currently serve, we will approach  them far more conservatively for 2026. We may need to make the difficult  decision to exit select markets if we are unable to achieve the rates necessary for  higher market - wide morbidity. Additionally, due to the projected expiration of  premium subsidies across the ACA market our membership should decline\nsignificantly and we are mindful of the potential for adverse selection dynamics  as we re - price these offerings for next year.  In Medicaid , there remains a lag between funding levels and member health risk  and we expect this to continue into 2026, resulting in additional margin  compression in th e   business including a loss within the non - dual segment of  Medicaid in 2026.   Membership losses from early adoption of recent legislation is  also factored into our initial views for 2026. Wherever states support responsible  funding for Medicaid, we remain committed to serving people through that  program and view this as integral to our mission.  The American health system’s long - standing cost problem is accelerating. We  are embracing our responsibility to continue to drive better health outcomes while  trying to keep health care affordable for all Americans.  The operational and pricing strategies I have described reflect our understanding  of the challenges we face as a company and a society, and our dedication to  responsibly navigating the current financial pressures so that we can set a stable  course for the future.  I’ll now turn it over to Patrick Conway, CEO of Optum.  Patrick Conway  Thanks ,   Tim.  Clearly, Optum’s performance this year has also not met expectations   –   yours or  ours. Echoing Tim and Steve, we are approaching this with humility and the need  for deep analysis of key issues, and commitment to substantially improved  execution. Serving our patients and customers is at the heart of our mission and  business and we have the opportunity to truly help make the health system better  for everyone.\nTo do that, we need to refocus on our performance discipline with a bias for  action and transparency for all stakeholders.  We have launched our agenda of change at Optum, starting with the evolution of  our leadership team.   Roger Connor brings tremendous experience in  organizational execution as our chief financial officer. Krista Nelson is a deeply  experienced health care operator now in the new role of chief operating officer of  Optum Health. Dhivya Suryadevara is already reenergizing product development,  marketing and service as the new CEO of Optum Insight. And Jon Mahrt brings  his unmatched pharmacy services experience to bolster the already compelling  offerings of Optum Rx.  These are not the only people in new roles and there will be more. We are taking  these and many other steps swiftly to enable Optum to recapture its historic  momentum.  Let me turn now to a review of our businesses, starting with Optum Health   –  where improved execution is needed most and where we are experiencing the  greatest pressures to our business.  Our belief remains steadfast: value - based care has the potential to transform  health   care. Yet even as we struggle to align this model with new funding  dynamics, it consistently delivers better outcomes. Tim highlighted the  challenges of rising health care unit costs, accelerating service volumes and  provider coding intensity, which further underscores that value - based care  remains the most effective method for compensating providers to improve and  sustain a patient’s health in contrast to simply increasing the volume and prices  of services.  Research consistently supports this premise, showing Medicare Advantage  patients in fully accountable arrangements are 20% less likely to be hospitalized  and experience 11% fewer ER visits compared to those in fee - for - service. We  are early in our value - based care journey. We know we have real and self -\ninflicted executional challenges and we bear the responsibility to get this right,  recognizing that urgent work lies ahead.  We have spent a decade assembling a care delivery model today serving nearly  20 million patients across three lines of business   –   value - based care, fee - for -  service care delivery and services, the latter two of which help further enable  value - based care.  The first category, value - based care, has grown to account for approximately  65% of Optum Health’s revenues   and serves 5 million patients in fully  accountable arrangements. I’ll provide more details on this in a moment but first  will detail the gap to our original Optum Health outlook.  Overall, Optum Health earnings in 2025 are approximately $6.6   billion   below our  expectations. To break this down:  •   Approximately $3.6   billion , or 55%, is concentrated in our value - based  care business with three principal drivers of roughly equal weight:  o   1 :   The mix of enrollment, including more complex and dually eligible  members, and more new - to - Optum patients who were  underserved;  o   2 :   Accelerated medical trend, particularly physician and outpatient  in Medicare and behavioral in Medicaid.  o   And   3 :   Under - estimation of new members’ risk status as they come  into our care and sub - optimal execution of the V28 risk model  transition;  •   Second category   -   Another $2   billion , or 30%, relates to the decision to  discontinue previously planned portfolio actions.  •   And about $1   billion , or 15%, is from a combination of lower service  volumes in our services businesses, some non - recurring prior period  impacts and the slowing of tuck - in acquisitions. For example, on lower  service volumes, in 2025 we planned for   approximately   20 million fee - for -\nservice visits in our care delivery clinics and we are tracking 19 million  visits, or 5% below this expecta tion Let me dive a bit deeper specifically  into factors affecting our value - based care business:  •   First, V28. This industry - wide shift is effectively a price reduction that we  now estimate created an $11   bill ion   headwind over three years for Optum  Health, with ~$7   billion   that will be realized through 2025. That is $2 billion  and $1 billion, respectively, more than our initial estimates while we also  overestimated the impact and mis - executed the planned efforts to offset  the V28 funding cuts.  •   Second, enrollment mix. Consistent with Q1, in 2025 we have an  unanticipated number of new - to - Optum Health patients who were  previously underserved. These new patients are largely in markets where  numerous plan exits occurred. They include complex patients who require  time to be managed effectively by us. This mix impact implies negative  margins near double - digits for these new patients, which will improve  meaningfully in 2026.  •   Lastly, the elevated medical trend we recognized in the second quarter  was exacerbated by insufficient pricing within United Healthcare and other  payer partners pulling through in the form of insufficient capitation rates for  Optum.  Despite these headwinds, Optum ’s fully accountable value - based care business  is delivering an operating margin of about 1% in 2025. This compares to full year  operating margins of over 3% in 2024 and nearly 5% in 2023.  A large part of the mis - execution in addressing the V28 funding cuts was due to a  non - standardized and overly localized management approach which we are  addressing with urgency. We are driving to a consistent and much more  concentrated regional operating model with four market leaders. We are  evaluating our position in each market. We will shift risk back to the original  underwriters until we have the hardened capacity to navigate it under value -\nbased   constructs.  And Optum will be much more disciplined in taking risk arrangements in product  designs and constructs that allow value - based care to have its intended impact.  Th e   margin compression reflects significant growth in new membership cohorts   –  with nearly 40% of the patients served today having come in since the beginning  of 2024. It also reflects the pull - through from   Medicare Advantage pricing  dislocation Tim described, and the V28 payment cuts.  Regarding patient cohorts: in our value - based care practices, margins improve  the longer patients remain. Our most mature value - based care cohorts   –   those  from 2021 and prior   –   are operating at an estimated 8%+ margin in 2025.   Those  in   2022   and   2023 cohorts are operating at a 2% margin; the 2024 through 2025  groups are at negative margins.  Strong physician engagement, appropriate medical diagnosis, and improved,  consistent quality of care continues to drive year over year improvement in a  cohort’s financial performance and in their health. But it ’ s taking too long and  there is too much variability in results among practices, and we are actively  addressing those factors.  That’s the overall picture of what is happening. I’ll turn now to remediation. Our  plan for improvement has four key elements:  First and foremost, we are improving the implementation and consistency of our  clinical model, which is anchored in primary care and supported by wraparound  services that continue to outperform on quality and cost.  Second, we are committed to margin recovery in value - based care.   We’ve  aligned our 2026 benefits and product portfolio and footprint with our payor  partners to address the final year of V28 headwinds. We plan to cease  arrangements for about 200,000 patients largely in fully accountable PPO\nproducts, representing approximately 40% of the PPO patients we serve today.  We expect to keep narrowing our exposure beyond 2026.  We are increasing rates to reflect the higher risk profiles and acuity we are  seeing and expect to continue. We believe the combination of these activities will  mitigate about half of the remaining $4 billion V28 headwind in 2026.   The  remainder of our offset will come from operating cost discipline and consistent  execution of our care programs which enhance engagement, diagnosis accuracy  and quality outcomes, and reduce overall cost of care.  With 2026 being the final year of   V 28 phase - in, you should expect 2026 value -  based care margins to remain relatively consistent with the 1% margin we are  achieving this year, and then begin to advance again in 2027 and beyond.  We are optimizing our portfolio of clinical practices. We are managing our fee - for -  service and fully accountable risk practices to align with performance  expectations, transitioning to partial risk or service arrangements where  necessary, and exiting fully accountable products in certain markets.  Third, we are aggressively advancing operational disciplines across our portfolio  of businesses. The more concentrated operating model I mentioned earlier plays  into more standardized approaches, predictable outcomes and lower operating  costs. We will complete the final stages of our technology integration, which will  enable meaningful advances with emerging technologies like AI to drive  efficiency gains. For 2026 we expect to deliver almost $1   billion   in cost  reductions.  Finally, beyond value - based care, Optum Health also includes fee - for - service  care delivery, including home care, ambulatory surgical care and medical  practices that are not yet fully accountable but support value - based care.   These  together account for 15% of Optum Health’s revenues. Most of these businesses  are performing well and operate at low double - digit margins. However, the  primary care and multi - specialty medical practices that are not yet fully  accountable are running at   negative margins   –   generating hundreds of millions of\nlosses this year alone   –   placing the overall fee - for - service care delivery business  in the mid - single digit margin range.  So, we are actively working to improve payment yields and productivity while  growing these high - value services and fee - for - service margins. We are targeting  growth for these services which are projected to deliver strong year - over - year  earnings growth in 2026.  The third component of Optum Health   –   services   –   is comprised of businesses  including managed behavioral health, military and veterans and health financial  services. These account for about 20% of Optum Health revenues and combined  have   an   almost 10% operating margins.  Overall at Optum Health, while we expect continued pressure for the rest of this  year, we anticipate meaningful improvement in our operations and with earnings  growth in 2026, albeit with a longer path to recovery in our value - based care  business. We now see Optum Health long - term margins in the 6 - 8% range, and  at about 5% for value - based care specifically, as we see significant growth  opportunity for the decade to come.   The overall blended margin will reflect the  early year investment losses generated by new cohorts.   Optum Health is early in  its development and mis - execution is a clear setback, but the long - term growth  potential and expectations remain intact   and significant .  Moving to Optum Insight   –   there is a great need and appetite for technology and  data products to help the health system perform more efficiently and effectively  yet Optum Insight has not fully capitalized on this opportunity. That’s largely due  to an unfocused suite of products, lagging innovation, and longer than expected  impact from last year’s cyberattack, which, unfortunately, came at the expense of  being able to drill down on business innovation, operations and growth.  But as I mentioned earlier, we have a talented team in place now and continue to  recruit talent to develop the next generation of products rooted in AI.\nAs it relates specifically to 2025, we are adjusting our outlook downward by $1  billion .   About half of this is due to a more gradual recovery than initially expected  in some of our volume - based businesses due to Change Healthcare and one -  time cyber - related expenses.  The other half is due to pausing previously planned portfolio actions so that we  can prioritize growth and innovation across our broader portfolio.  At Optum Rx, client retention remains high and consistent with past years. We  expect revenue growth of $18 billion, or 13%, and earnings growth of just over  $200   million , or nearly 4%, driven by low - margin specialty drugs.  Compared to the strong revenue growth rate, our earnings growth has been  constrained by four main factors: the removal of portfolio actions from our plan is  a roughly $150   million   headwind; another $50   million   is from a couple of   ancillary  businesses, where we are taking aggressive corrective actions and adjusting  plans; and the impact of the initial launch phase of our private label business,  Nuvaila,   is   a roughly $150   million   headwind. As it matures, we see Nuvaila  delivering affordability for clients and consumers and strong earnings for Optum  Rx.  Additionally, GLP1s, wh ich can benefit ap propriate patients , continue to impact  earnings, representing a $160   million   headwind for our pharmacy business.  After three months in this role, I want to thank the thousands of people serving in  Optum, and to let external stakeholders know that the problems are fixable, and  that Optum will continue to drive long - term growth and make the most of our  opportunity to serve people.  I’ll turn it over to our president and chief financial officer, John Rex  John?  John Rex  Thanks, Patrick.\nI’ll first walk through second quarter results, then provide some color around the  underlying assumptions within our re - established `25 outlook.  Starting with the second quarter, UnitedHealth Group reported revenues of  nearly $112 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year, which reflected growth  across UnitedHealthcare and Optum.  Adjusted earnings per share of $4.08 was below the same period last year. This  was due primarily to the pricing and medical cost trend factors at  UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health. Included is about $1.2 billion in discrete  items. A little over half reflects the recognition of unfavorable impacts to our ACA  exchange offerings, which I will describe later in more detail. The remainder is  the settlement of several outstanding items which have been in dispute or for  which collection has recently become questionable. Most of these items arise  from prior years. The full year ‘25 outlook we’ve offered today accommodates   $1  billion   in additional potential such items that we may seek to resolve in - year.  Now on to business overviews.  At UnitedHealthcare, second quarter revenues grew by over $12 billion to $86.1  billion, while operating earnings declined by $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion primarily  due to the medical trend factors Tim discussed.  Within our Medicare businesses, year - to - date Medicare Advantage growth is  650,000 people, including those who are dually eligible for Medicaid and  Medicare.  As noted, the second quarter results reflect just over $600 million of unfavorable  impacts from our ACA exchange business, which includes acceleration of  anticipated second half losses with the establishment of a premium deficiency  reserve.   This is due to the higher patient morbidity that is pervasive across the  entire exchange market.\nGiven competitive market dynamics, we have less member growth within our  commercial offerings than initially anticipated. ACA exchange drives about one -  third of our reduced commercial risk member growth outlook for 2025, with  group - insured comprising much of the rest.  As outlined earlier, our Medicaid offerings continue to experience pressure from  the lag in state rate updates relative to the health status of the members being  served. Our state partners remain highly engaged in ongoing rate conversations  and we are closely attuned to   the   federal funding changes and the continued  pace of medical cost trends, particularly in behavioral health.  Moving to Optum.  Optum Health revenues were $25.2 billion in the second quarter, a decline of  $1.8 billion from last year. This was driven by the previously noted contract  adjustments and the effects of the Medicare funding reductions. Optum Health  now expects to add 300,000 new value - based care patients this year compared  to the initial 650,000 outlook as it seeks to focus on improving operating  performance. As noted, we‘ve updated our long - term target margin objective for  Optum Health to the 6 to 8   %   range.  Optum Insight had revenues of $4.8 billion, an increase of $285 million or 6%  year over year. We continue to progress on customer recovery following last  year’s cyber event, albeit pacing more slowly than expected and this is a  component of the reduced full year outlook. The contract revenue backlog at the  end of the second quarter was $32.1 billion.  Optum Rx second quarter revenues grew $6 billion, or 19%, over last year to  $38.5 billion, driven by new customer adds as well as continued contribution from  specialty products. Total adjusted scripts were 414 million compared to 399  million in the year ago quarter.  Moving on to 2025 guidance.\nOur adjusted earnings   outlook is at least $16 per share. Revenues will approach  $448 billion, growth of 11% over ‘24.  We now expect a full - year medical care ratio of 89.25 % , plus or minus 25 basis  points. This compares to the initial 86.5 %   mid - point we offered at the end of last  year, with the increase driven by the factors discussed.  Within this, seasonal pacing compared to historical measures is impacted  somewhat by the Part D coverage gap modifications due to the Inflation  Reduction Act. With first half results, at the midpoint that places the second half  at just under 91.5%, with the fourth quarter expected to be the highest and, at  this distance, a relatively proportionate distribution on either side.  The full year outlook contemplates a total of $1.6 billion of potential settlement  items, an incremental $1 billion over the $600 million recognized in the second  quarter.  Our tax rate for the year is now estimated at about 18.5 % , affected by our  revised earnings outlook as expected benefits remain steady, while earnings  declined. The lower tax expense in the second quarter reflects the year - to - date  recognition of the updated full year effective tax rate. We expect the second half  rate to be just over 20 % .  Full year ’25 cash flows from operations are expected to be about $16 billion or  1.1 times net income.  In June, we increased our dividend by 5% and we will strike a balance as to how  we use capital over the near - term, being thoughtful about maintaining a strong  balance sheet and credit rating and mindful of long - standing commitments,  including the pending Amedisys transaction. Our updated share count of 912 to  914 million compares to the original outlook of 918 to 923 million and considers  only share repurchase s   completed earlier this year.\nWe will continue to balance and assess our capital priorities as we progress to  returning to the performance levels we know we can achieve.  With that, I will hand it back over to St ephen   before we head into Q&A.  Ste phen   Hemsley  Thanks, John.  This is a challenging year for our enterprise. But I feel strongly we can overcome  these challenges   –   as we have done before. I can see the depth of the  commitment of our team. We are regaining the intensity, the precision, and the  execution al   disciplines required to perform consistently   and reliably . Our  customers and our shareholders deserve it. And the health system expects us to  function to our full potential.  As we look toward 2026 and beyond, we expect the efforts we discussed  throughout today’s call to steadily improve our performance.   It begins with  respecting pricing basics, advancing our foresight acumen and just better, more  intense,   more decisive   overall management.  We will be driving better business practices, better consumer and provider  experience, and accelerating investment s   in key areas to both strengthen our  foundations and modernize our business es , anchored in practical innovations  and   scaled AI applications.  We are continuing to evaluate the investments we need to make in the near - term  to meet our long - term growth potential while acknowledging the challenging  environment in the year ahead.  As I mentioned at our shareholder meeting in June, we are rebuilding   the   trust  through both change and through increased transparency. That includes work to  ensure a wide range of stakeholders have confidence in the integrity of our  Company and our business practices.   This work is moving forward   in   our  assessment of key policies, practices and associated processes by the end of\nthe third quarter and our first performance measures report in the fourth quarter.  We have retained independent experts to oversee and assist in these reviews,  including the Analysis Group and FTI Consulting. We will use this to continually  strengthen and advance our strong compliance environment.  Looking to 2026, at this distance I would expect   solid but   moderate earnings  growth. As we look further ahead, we see our earnings growth outlook  strengthening quickly in 2027 and pacing steadily upward over the succeeding  years.\n\n[UNH-Q2-2025-Remarks.pdf]\nEarnings Conference Call  Second   Quarter   202 5   Remarks  July 29 , 202 5  Moderator:  Good morning,   and w elcome to the UnitedHealth Group   Second   Quarter   20 2 5  Earnings Conference Call. A question and answer session will follow  UnitedHealth Group’s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being  recorded.  Here is some important introductory information.   This call contains “forward -  looking” statements   under U.S. federal securities laws.   These statements are  subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ  materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of  some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with  t he Securities   and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements  included in our current and periodic filings.  This call will also reference non - GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non -  GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the “Financial &   Earnings Reports ”  section of the Company’s Investor   Relations   page at  www.unitedhealthgroup.com.  Information presented on this call is contained in the Earnings Release we issued  this morning and in our Form 8 - K dated   July 29 , 202 5 , which may be accessed  from the Investor   Relations   page of the Company’s website. I   will   now turn the  conference over to the   chairman and   chief executive officer of UnitedHealth  Group,   Stephen Hemsley .  Ste phen   Hemsley  Thank you.   Good morning   a nd t hank you for joining. Today our prepared remarks  will be a little longer than usual   so we will be allowing more time for your  questions.  As we begin, I want to recognize   our employees who have been so dedicated to  serving our patients, consumers and customers during a prolonged, challenging  period for our business. And I’d like to thank our leadership team, many of whom  are new in their roles, for their willingness to join me in looking hard at our\nbusinesses, getting a grounded assessment of our action plans, re - baselining our  outlook and moving apace to advance the performance of each of our  businesses.  This morning, I know you are eager to get into the underlying details of our  revised financial outlook, which we will do. But at this moment, I believe it ’s   also  important to convey the tone we are setting at this enterprise.  More than anything, it is a tone of change and reform born out of a recommitment  to our mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system  work better for everyone. It ’s   a mission that requires a commitment to a culture of  values, of service, responsibility, integrity and humility.  We pair that mission - driven ambition of reform with a keen sense of the  opportunity and the expectation to perform better than we ever have. As we  continue to assess the state of our businesses, it is very apparent that some  require a fundamental reorientation, others require building and nurturing, and  others must be   re considered and   re directed to original purpose. We also  recognize the need and the opportunity to revisit and address critical processes  and fundamental business practices, both internal and market - facing. We are  acutely aware we have an enormous responsibility for providing care   for   million s  of   people and for protecting the government and private programs we partner in.  As such we have embarked on a real cultural shift in our relationships with  regulators and all external stakeholders. We intend to be proactively engaged,  constructive and responsive to the concerns of all stakeholders and in our  engagement with them.  We have the chance to reposition our enterprise as a far more modern, reliable,  consumer and provider friendly enterprise using new technologies and  approaches, and we are going to pursue that course.  Pursuit of these opportunities aligns to and enables our reform and change  mandate and allows us to better achieve our mission and to steadily perform  better in doing so.\nWe are on this course against a challenging environment which includes:  •   A generational pullback in Medicare funding, set in motion in 2023 and  playing out through 2026.  •   Unprecedented medical cost trend , measured in both intensity of services  used as well as unit prices and more aggressive care provider coding and  billing technologies.  •   The prospects for further contraction of the Medicaid and Exchange  markets.  •   The growing need to invest in the opportunities new technologies offer and  the expectation of all health care entities to offer a better experience for  consumers, customers, care providers and employees.  •   And finally, the continuing public controversy over long - standing practices  and complexities across the entire health care sector,   particularly  managed care , which bears the critical roles for coverage, for care  management and for pricing for the intensity and the cost of services used  into the benefit products and programs for the entire health care market.  As a leading provider of health services, we must help advance a better  health system.  We are committed to engaging in these pursuits with a sense of purpose and  better partnership with all stakeholders, transparency in our business and  reporting practices and continued integrity in all we do.  Beyond the environmental factors that are affecting the entire sector and more  specifically to us, we have made pricing and operational mistakes a s   well as  others . They are getting the needed attention.   Our critical processes, including  risk status, care management, pharmaceutical services and others are being  reviewed by independent experts and they will be reviewed every year and  reported on. And these processes can be reviewed at any time by outside  stakeholders. While we believe in   our   oversight and the integrity of these  processes, wherever they are determined to be at variance with prescribed  practice, they will be promptly remediated and we ’ ll continue on this path.\nAll the foregoing   is   fully addressable. We can steadily restore our performance to  levels consistent with our mission and stakeholder expectations   –   all as we  strengthen an institutional culture aligned to that mission   and accountable for  performance  Over the last 60 days or more, we have made extensive management and  operational changes aligned to this agenda of reform and performance. Other  such changes   –  •   to   leadership,  •   to our businesses, our culture, approaches and practices,  •   and to our board, governance and succession oversight, as appropriate,  •   will continue to be made as we proceed through this period.  With those thoughts in mind, Tim Noel and Patrick Conway, heads of  UnitedHealthcare and Optum respectively, will walk through some of the  specifics in their businesses. John Rex will discuss financial performance and the  elements affecting our outlook.   A nd   I’ll come back with some closing thoughts,  and then we will have ample time for questions and answers.   Tim.  Tim Noel  Thanks, Ste phen .  I want to start by emphasizing that we are approaching our business with greater  humility, greater transparency, and a renewed determination to meet your  expectations and our standards.  The primary driver of the UnitedHealthcare earnings shortfall for 2025 is that our  pricing assumptions were well - short of actual medical costs.   Our current view for  2025 reflects $6.5   billion   more in medical costs than we anticipated in our initial  outlook.\nA little over half, or $3.6   billion ,   of this is in our broad - based Medicare portfolio.  About one - third, or $2.3   billion , is in the commercial business, split evenly  between ACA plans and our employer business. The remaining trend pressure is  related to Medicaid, most notably due to elevated behavioral trend.  In addition to trend - driven issues, the updated 2025 outlook removes about $1  billion from previously planned portfolio actions that we are no longer pursuing.  It also reflects about $850   million   of other items including unfavorable prior period  items   –   primarily from 2024   –   and recognition of several one - time settlements.  We know these are serious challenges.   We are humbled by them and will carry  that sense of humility more deeply into our culture.   But we also believe we can  resolve our current issues and recapture our earnings growth potential.  Let me now provide an update on   where each business stands,   starting with  Medicare .  When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half  of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did  not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are  now experiencing. This was compounded by the magnitude of plan exits across  the sector and the extent to which we now see care providers placing further  service intensity into the health system.   The increasingly flexible orientation to  which our Medicare networks and plan designs have evolved over recent years  left us less able to address these trends in - year.  On trend specifically, the increase in care activity across Individual and Group  Medicare Advantage we saw earlier this year has now affected   complex  populations and our Medicare Supplement business as well.  Across Medicare Advantage, physician and outpatient care together represent  70 %   of the pressure year to date; however, inpatient utilization has accelerated  through Q2 and we expect will comprise a relatively larger portion of the pressure  over the full year.\nWe continue to see utilization increases in ER and observation stays, and  consistently see more services being offered and bundled as part of each ER  visit and clinical encounter.  In short: most encounters are intensifying in services and costing more. Th e  higher trend is broad - based geographically and across our membership,  including our large retained membership base.  To put this into context, we had initially assumed Medicare Advantage medical  cost trend of just over 5 %   when configuring our 2025 bids, in lin...\n\n\nPlease analyze according to the system prompt above.",

Pursuit of these opportunities aligns to and enables our reform and change  mandate and allows us to better achieve our mission and to steadily perform  better in doing so.\nWe are on this course against a challenging environment which includes:  •   A generational pullback in Medicare funding, set in motion in 2023 and  playing out through 2026.  •   Unprecedented medical cost trend , measured in both intensity of services  used as well as unit prices and more aggressive care provider coding and  billing technologies.  •   The prospects for further contraction of the Medicaid and Exchange  markets.  •   The growing need to invest in the opportunities new technologies offer and  the expectation of all health care entities to offer a better experience for  consumers, customers, care providers and employees.  •   And finally, the continuing public controversy over long - standing practices  and complexities across the entire health care sector,   particularly  managed care , which bears the critical roles for coverage, for care  management and for pricing for the intensity and the cost of services used  into the benefit products and programs for the entire health care market.  As a leading provider of health services, we must help advance a better  health system.  We are committed to engaging in these pursuits with a sense of purpose and  better partnership with all stakeholders, transparency in our business and  reporting practices and continued integrity in all we do.  Beyond the environmental factors that are affecting the entire sector and more  specifically to us, we have made pricing and operational mistakes a s   well as  others . They are getting the needed attention.   Our critical processes, including  risk status, care management, pharmaceutical services and others are being  reviewed by independent experts and they will be reviewed every year and  reported on. And these processes can be reviewed at any time by outside  stakeholders. While we believe in   our   oversight and the integrity of these  processes, wherever they are determined to be at variance with prescribed  practice, they will be promptly remediated and we ’ ll continue on this path.\nAll the foregoing   is   fully addressable. We can steadily restore our performance to  levels consistent with our mission and stakeholder expectations   –   all as we  strengthen an institutional culture aligned to that mission   and accountable for  performance  Over the last 60 days or more, we have made extensive management and  operational changes aligned to this agenda of reform and performance. Other  such changes   –  •   to   leadership,  •   to our businesses, our culture, approaches and practices,  •   and to our board, governance and succession oversight, as appropriate,  •   will continue to be made as we proceed through this period.  With those thoughts in mind, Tim Noel and Patrick Conway, heads of  UnitedHealthcare and Optum respectively, will walk through some of the  specifics in their businesses. John Rex will discuss financial performance and the  elements affecting our outlook.   A nd   I’ll come back with some closing thoughts,  and then we will have ample time for questions and answers.   Tim.  Tim Noel  Thanks, Ste phen .  I want to start by emphasizing that we are approaching our business with greater  humility, greater transparency, and a renewed determination to meet your  expectations and our standards.  The primary driver of the UnitedHealthcare earnings shortfall for 2025 is that our  pricing assumptions were well - short of actual medical costs.   Our current view for  2025 reflects $6.5   billion   more in medical costs than we anticipated in our initial  outlook.\nA little over half, or $3.6   billion ,   of this is in our broad - based Medicare portfolio.  About one - third, or $2.3   billion , is in the commercial business, split evenly  between ACA plans and our employer business. The remaining trend pressure is  related to Medicaid, most notably due to elevated behavioral trend.  In addition to trend - driven issues, the updated 2025 outlook removes about $1  billion from previously planned portfolio actions that we are no longer pursuing.  It also reflects about $850   million   of other items including unfavorable prior period  items   –   primarily from 2024   –   and recognition of several one - time settlements.  We know these are serious challenges.   We are humbled by them and will carry  that sense of humility more deeply into our culture.   But we also believe we can  resolve our current issues and recapture our earnings growth potential.  Let me now provide an update on   where each business stands,   starting with  Medicare .  When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half  of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did  not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are  now experiencing. This was compounded by the magnitude of plan exits across  the sector and the extent to which we now see care providers placing further  service intensity into the health system.   The increasingly flexible orientation to  which our Medicare networks and plan designs have evolved over recent years  left us less able to address these trends in - year.  On trend specifically, the increase in care activity across Individual and Group  Medicare Advantage we saw earlier this year has now affected   complex  populations and our Medicare Supplement business as well.  Across Medicare Advantage, physician and outpatient care together represent  70 %   of the pressure year to date; however, inpatient utilization has accelerated  through Q2 and we expect will comprise a relatively larger portion of the pressure  over the full year.\nWe continue to see utilization increases in ER and observation stays, and  consistently see more services being offered and bundled as part of each ER  visit and clinical encounter.  In short: most encounters are intensifying in services and costing more. Th e  higher trend is broad - based geographically and across our membership,  including our large retained membership base.  To put this into context, we had initially assumed Medicare Advantage medical  cost trend of just over 5 %   when configuring our 2025 bids, in line with our  normalized trend experience in 2024. We now expect full year 2025 trend to be  approximately 7.5 % .  Medicare Supplement, which typically is representative of overall care activity  levels and cost trends in Medicare fee for service broadly, is up similarly in 2025  compared to historical levels. We expect that trend to be over 11% this year vs. 8  to 9% in recent years   --   further confirming the broad - based nature of the care  activity,   and   the coding and billing patterns trends we are seeing.  On Commercial :   We are seeing higher - than - expected medical cost increases,  particularly in outpatient care and, although to a lesser extent, inpatient care.  Orthopedic spending and pharmacy infusions are notable factors here. In the  ACA business, the revenue impact resulting from a difference between the  morbidity that we priced for and what we experienced is the primary cause of our  underperformance.  One example of the elevated Commercial trend is group fully - insured.   There,  trend is approaching 11%, which is approximately 100bps higher than our initial  expectations.  Moving to Medicaid …Similar elevated trends are apparent and are further  affected by increasing and unanticipated acceleration of costs in behavioral  health, where trend is running at 20 % , as well as in pharmacy and home health.\nWe anticipate the existing rate and acuity mismatch will extend well into next  year.  Beyond these segment - specific factors, there are other broad drivers of higher  medical costs. There has been a marked increase in health care costs due in  part to increases in service intensity per encounter. For example, in Medicare  Advantage, higher frequency of physician rounding, testing and related services  of specialists and in ER settings are contributing to elevated outpatient spend.  In addition to strongly responsive pricing for 2026, which I will speak to in a  moment, we are intensifying our remediation actions.  We have stepped up our audit, clinical policy and payment integrity tools to  protect customers and patients from unnecessary costs. These efforts ensure  care is delivered in appropriate settings and grounded in safety and quality while  also identifying waste and abuse in outlier coding and billing practices. We are  shifting to narrower networks and focusing on more disciplined managed  products, particularly in Medicare Advantage. And we have scaled our AI efforts  across health plan operations, which improves the patient and provider service  experiences while driving cost savings.  Lastly, in Medicaid , we continue to actively engage with state partners, using  both past experience and data - driven insights to show the need for immediate  and more regular rate updates.  Taken together, this work is helping restore our operational muscle and  reclaiming executional rigor, helped by modern tools and driven by relentless  focus on improvement.  Turning now to 2026 …Our pricing strategy is intensely focused on margin  recovery and moving back toward our earnings growth targets.  In Medicare , we have historically targeted an operating margin range of 3 to 5 %   .  Now, with the changes from the Inflation Reduction Act on the Part D program,\nwhich resulted in higher revenue, but do not impact earnings, the equivalent  target margin range is in the 2 to 4 %   range.  We are working intensively to remediate Medicare through pricing, product  design and benefit changes that will enable us to be within the lower half of the  targeted margin ranges in 2026, and advancing further in 2027.  Our Medicare Advantage pricing strategy for 2026 assumes a trend approaching  10 % , compared to our current 7.5 %   trend expectation. This accounts for trend  acceleration and incorporates factors such as changes in fee schedules and the  continuation of higher yields from provider coding and billing practices.  Considering the continued cost trend and funding pressures, and the need to  support margin recovery, we have made significant adjustments to benefits.  Additionally   –   and unfortunately   –   given these pressures we have made the  difficult decision to exit plans that currently serve over 600,000 members,  primarily in less managed products such as PPO offerings. We have taken  similar approaches for Medicare Supplement, Group MA, and standalone Part D  pricing for next year. We will be watching the market closely as the 2026  Medicare offerings become public so we can better assess our market  positioning and respond quickly.  For Commercial , because renewals occur over the course of the year, we are  able to price for changes more dynamically.   Our pricing will anticipate high er  trend continuing into 2026 and 2027.   We expect increased membership decline,  as well as shifts into both level - funded and self - funded product categories,  because of higher medical cost trends.  In the individual exchange business, while we are prepared to continue to  participate in the majority of the 30 markets we currently serve, we will approach  them far more conservatively for 2026. We may need to make the difficult  decision to exit select markets if we are unable to achieve the rates necessary for  higher market - wide morbidity. Additionally, due to the projected expiration of  premium subsidies across the ACA market our membership should decline\nsignificantly and we are mindful of the potential for adverse selection dynamics  as we re - price these offerings for next year.  In Medicaid , there remains a lag between funding levels and member health risk  and we expect this to continue into 2026, resulting in additional margin  compression in th e   business including a loss within the non - dual segment of  Medicaid in 2026.   Membership losses from early adoption of recent legislation is  also factored into our initial views for 2026. Wherever states support responsible  funding for Medicaid, we remain committed to serving people through that  program and view this as integral to our mission.  The American health system’s long - standing cost problem is accelerating. We  are embracing our responsibility to continue to drive better health outcomes while  trying to keep health care affordable for all Americans.  The operational and pricing strategies I have described reflect our understanding  of the challenges we face as a company and a society, and our dedication to  responsibly navigating the current financial pressures so that we can set a stable  course for the future.  I’ll now turn it over to Patrick Conway, CEO of Optum.  Patrick Conway  Thanks ,   Tim.  Clearly, Optum’s performance this year has also not met expectations   –   yours or  ours. Echoing Tim and Steve, we are approaching this with humility and the need  for deep analysis of key issues, and commitment to substantially improved  execution. Serving our patients and customers is at the heart of our mission and  business and we have the opportunity to truly help make the health system better  for everyone.\nTo do that, we need to refocus on our performance discipline with a bias for  action and transparency for all stakeholders.  We have launched our agenda of change at Optum, starting with the evolution of  our leadership team.   Roger Connor brings tremendous experience in  organizational execution as our chief financial officer. Krista Nelson is a deeply  experienced health care operator now in the new role of chief operating officer of  Optum Health. Dhivya Suryadevara is already reenergizing product development,  marketing and service as the new CEO of Optum Insight. And Jon Mahrt brings  his unmatched pharmacy services experience to bolster the already compelling  offerings of Optum Rx.  These are not the only people in new roles and there will be more. We are taking  these and many other steps swiftly to enable Optum to recapture its historic  momentum.  Let me turn now to a review of our businesses, starting with Optum Health   –  where improved execution is needed most and where we are experiencing the  greatest pressures to our business.  Our belief remains steadfast: value - based care has the potential to transform  health   care. Yet even as we struggle to align this model with new funding  dynamics, it consistently delivers better outcomes. Tim highlighted the  challenges of rising health care unit costs, accelerating service volumes and  provider coding intensity, which further underscores that value - based care  remains the most effective method for compensating providers to improve and  sustain a patient’s health in contrast to simply increasing the volume and prices  of services.  Research consistently supports this premise, showing Medicare Advantage  patients in fully accountable arrangements are 20% less likely to be hospitalized  and experience 11% fewer ER visits compared to those in fee - for - service. We  are early in our value - based care journey. We know we have real and self -\ninflicted executional challenges and we bear the responsibility to get this right,  recognizing that urgent work lies ahead.  We have spent a decade assembling a care delivery model today serving nearly  20 million patients across three lines of business   –   value - based care, fee - for -  service care delivery and services, the latter two of which help further enable  value - based care.  The first category, value - based care, has grown to account for approximately  65% of Optum Health’s revenues   and serves 5 million patients in fully  accountable arrangements. I’ll provide more details on this in a moment but first  will detail the gap to our original Optum Health outlook.  Overall, Optum Health earnings in 2025 are approximately $6.6   billion   below our  expectations. To break this down:  •   Approximately $3.6   billion , or 55%, is concentrated in our value - based  care business with three principal drivers of roughly equal weight:  o   1 :   The mix of enrollment, including more complex and dually eligible  members, and more new - to - Optum patients who were  underserved;  o   2 :   Accelerated medical trend, particularly physician and outpatient  in Medicare and behavioral in Medicaid.  o   And   3 :   Under - estimation of new members’ risk status as they come  into our care and sub - optimal execution of the V28 risk model  transition;  •   Second category   -   Another $2   billion , or 30%, relates to the decision to  discontinue previously planned portfolio actions.  •   And about $1   billion , or 15%, is from a combination of lower service  volumes in our services businesses, some non - recurring prior period  impacts and the slowing of tuck - in acquisitions. For example, on lower  service volumes, in 2025 we planned for   approximately   20 million fee - for -\nservice visits in our care delivery clinics and we are tracking 19 million  visits, or 5% below this expecta tion Let me dive a bit deeper specifically  into factors affecting our value - based care business:  •   First, V28. This industry - wide shift is effectively a price reduction that we  now estimate created an $11   bill ion   headwind over three years for Optum  Health, with ~$7   billion   that will be realized through 2025. That is $2 billion  and $1 billion, respectively, more than our initial estimates while we also  overestimated the impact and mis - executed the planned efforts to offset  the V28 funding cuts.  •   Second, enrollment mix. Consistent with Q1, in 2025 we have an  unanticipated number of new - to - Optum Health patients who were  previously underserved. These new patients are largely in markets where  numerous plan exits occurred. They include complex patients who require  time to be managed effectively by us. This mix impact implies negative  margins near double - digits for these new patients, which will improve  meaningfully in 2026.  •   Lastly, the elevated medical trend we recognized in the second quarter  was exacerbated by insufficient pricing within United Healthcare and other  payer partners pulling through in the form of insufficient capitation rates for  Optum.  Despite these headwinds, Optum ’s fully accountable value - based care business  is delivering an operating margin of about 1% in 2025. This compares to full year  operating margins of over 3% in 2024 and nearly 5% in 2023.  A large part of the mis - execution in addressing the V28 funding cuts was due to a  non - standardized and overly localized management approach which we are  addressing with urgency. We are driving to a consistent and much more  concentrated regional operating model with four market leaders. We are  evaluating our position in each market. We will shift risk back to the original  underwriters until we have the hardened capacity to navigate it under value -\nbased   constructs.  And Optum will be much more disciplined in taking risk arrangements in product  designs and constructs that allow value - based care to have its intended impact.  Th e   margin compression reflects significant growth in new membership cohorts   –  with nearly 40% of the patients served today having come in since the beginning  of 2024. It also reflects the pull - through from   Medicare Advantage pricing  dislocation Tim described, and the V28 payment cuts.  Regarding patient cohorts: in our value - based care practices, margins improve  the longer patients remain. Our most mature value - based care cohorts   –   those  from 2021 and prior   –   are operating at an estimated 8%+ margin in 2025.   Those  in   2022   and   2023 cohorts are operating at a 2% margin; the 2024 through 2025  groups are at negative margins.  Strong physician engagement, appropriate medical diagnosis, and improved,  consistent quality of care continues to drive year over year improvement in a  cohort’s financial performance and in their health. But it ’ s taking too long and  there is too much variability in results among practices, and we are actively  addressing those factors.  That’s the overall picture of what is happening. I’ll turn now to remediation. Our  plan for improvement has four key elements:  First and foremost, we are improving the implementation and consistency of our  clinical model, which is anchored in primary care and supported by wraparound  services that continue to outperform on quality and cost.  Second, we are committed to margin recovery in value - based care.   We’ve  aligned our 2026 benefits and product portfolio and footprint with our payor  partners to address the final year of V28 headwinds. We plan to cease  arrangements for about 200,000 patients largely in fully accountable PPO\nproducts, representing approximately 40% of the PPO patients we serve today.  We expect to keep narrowing our exposure beyond 2026.  We are increasing rates to reflect the higher risk profiles and acuity we are  seeing and expect to continue. We believe the combination of these activities will  mitigate about half of the remaining $4 billion V28 headwind in 2026.   The  remainder of our offset will come from operating cost discipline and consistent  execution of our care programs which enhance engagement, diagnosis accuracy  and quality outcomes, and reduce overall cost of care.  With 2026 being the final year of   V 28 phase - in, you should expect 2026 value -  based care margins to remain relatively consistent with the 1% margin we are  achieving this year, and then begin to advance again in 2027 and beyond.  We are optimizing our portfolio of clinical practices. We are managing our fee - for -  service and fully accountable risk practices to align with performance  expectations, transitioning to partial risk or service arrangements where  necessary, and exiting fully accountable products in certain markets.  Third, we are aggressively advancing operational disciplines across our portfolio  of businesses. The more concentrated operating model I mentioned earlier plays  into more standardized approaches, predictable outcomes and lower operating  costs. We will complete the final stages of our technology integration, which will  enable meaningful advances with emerging technologies like AI to drive  efficiency gains. For 2026 we expect to deliver almost $1   billion   in cost  reductions.  Finally, beyond value - based care, Optum Health also includes fee - for - service  care delivery, including home care, ambulatory surgical care and medical  practices that are not yet fully accountable but support value - based care.   These  together account for 15% of Optum Health’s revenues. Most of these businesses  are performing well and operate at low double - digit margins. However, the  primary care and multi - specialty medical practices that are not yet fully  accountable are running at   negative margins   –   generating hundreds of millions of\nlosses this year alone   –   placing the overall fee - for - service care delivery business  in the mid - single digit margin range.  So, we are actively working to improve payment yields and productivity while  growing these high - value services and fee - for - service margins. We are targeting  growth for these services which are projected to deliver strong year - over - year  earnings growth in 2026.  The third component of Optum Health   –   services   –   is comprised of businesses  including managed behavioral health, military and veterans and health financial  services. These account for about 20% of Optum Health revenues and combined  have   an   almost 10% operating margins.  Overall at Optum Health, while we expect continued pressure for the rest of this  year, we anticipate meaningful improvement in our operations and with earnings  growth in 2026, albeit with a longer path to recovery in our value - based care  business. We now see Optum Health long - term margins in the 6 - 8% range, and  at about 5% for value - based care specifically, as we see significant growth  opportunity for the decade to come.   The overall blended margin will reflect the  early year investment losses generated by new cohorts.   Optum Health is early in  its development and mis - execution is a clear setback, but the long - term growth  potential and expectations remain intact   and significant .  Moving to Optum Insight   –   there is a great need and appetite for technology and  data products to help the health system perform more efficiently and effectively  yet Optum Insight has not fully capitalized on this opportunity. That’s largely due  to an unfocused suite of products, lagging innovation, and longer than expected  impact from last year’s cyberattack, which, unfortunately, came at the expense of  being able to drill down on business innovation, operations and growth.  But as I mentioned earlier, we have a talented team in place now and continue to  recruit talent to develop the next generation of products rooted in AI.\nAs it relates specifically to 2025, we are adjusting our outlook downward by $1  billion .   About half of this is due to a more gradual recovery than initially expected  in some of our volume - based businesses due to Change Healthcare and one -  time cyber - related expenses.  The other half is due to pausing previously planned portfolio actions so that we  can prioritize growth and innovation across our broader portfolio.  At Optum Rx, client retention remains high and consistent with past years. We  expect revenue growth of $18 billion, or 13%, and earnings growth of just over  $200   million , or nearly 4%, driven by low - margin specialty drugs.  Compared to the strong revenue growth rate, our earnings growth has been  constrained by four main factors: the removal of portfolio actions from our plan is  a roughly $150   million   headwind; another $50   million   is from a couple of   ancillary  businesses, where we are taking aggressive corrective actions and adjusting  plans; and the impact of the initial launch phase of our private label business,  Nuvaila,   is   a roughly $150   million   headwind. As it matures, we see Nuvaila  delivering affordability for clients and consumers and strong earnings for Optum  Rx.  Additionally, GLP1s, wh ich can benefit ap propriate patients , continue to impact  earnings, representing a $160   million   headwind for our pharmacy business.  After three months in this role, I want to thank the thousands of people serving in  Optum, and to let external stakeholders know that the problems are fixable, and  that Optum will continue to drive long - term growth and make the most of our  opportunity to serve people.  I’ll turn it over to our president and chief financial officer, John Rex  John?  John Rex  Thanks, Patrick.\nI’ll first walk through second quarter results, then provide some color around the  underlying assumptions within our re - established `25 outlook.  Starting with the second quarter, UnitedHealth Group reported revenues of  nearly $112 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year, which reflected growth  across UnitedHealthcare and Optum.  Adjusted earnings per share of $4.08 was below the same period last year. This  was due primarily to the pricing and medical cost trend factors at  UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health. Included is about $1.2 billion in discrete  items. A little over half reflects the recognition of unfavorable impacts to our ACA  exchange offerings, which I will describe later in more detail. The remainder is  the settlement of several outstanding items which have been in dispute or for  which collection has recently become questionable. Most of these items arise  from prior years. The full year ‘25 outlook we’ve offered today accommodates   $1  billion   in additional potential such items that we may seek to resolve in - year.  Now on to business overviews.  At UnitedHealthcare, second quarter revenues grew by over $12 billion to $86.1  billion, while operating earnings declined by $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion primarily  due to the medical trend factors Tim discussed.  Within our Medicare businesses, year - to - date Medicare Advantage growth is  650,000 people, including those who are dually eligible for Medicaid and  Medicare.  As noted, the second quarter results reflect just over $600 million of unfavorable  impacts from our ACA exchange business, which includes acceleration of  anticipated second half losses with the establishment of a premium deficiency  reserve.   This is due to the higher patient morbidity that is pervasive across the  entire exchange market.\nGiven competitive market dynamics, we have less member growth within our  commercial offerings than initially anticipated. ACA exchange drives about one -  third of our reduced commercial risk member growth outlook for 2025, with  group - insured comprising much of the rest.  As outlined earlier, our Medicaid offerings continue to experience pressure from  the lag in state rate updates relative to the health status of the members being  served. Our state partners remain highly engaged in ongoing rate conversations  and we are closely attuned to   the   federal funding changes and the continued  pace of medical cost trends, particularly in behavioral health.  Moving to Optum.  Optum Health revenues were $25.2 billion in the second quarter, a decline of  $1.8 billion from last year. This was driven by the previously noted contract  adjustments and the effects of the Medicare funding reductions. Optum Health  now expects to add 300,000 new value - based care patients this year compared  to the initial 650,000 outlook as it seeks to focus on improving operating  performance. As noted, we‘ve updated our long - term target margin objective for  Optum Health to the 6 to 8   %   range.  Optum Insight had revenues of $4.8 billion, an increase of $285 million or 6%  year over year. We continue to progress on customer recovery following last  year’s cyber event, albeit pacing more slowly than expected and this is a  component of the reduced full year outlook. The contract revenue backlog at the  end of the second quarter was $32.1 billion.  Optum Rx second quarter revenues grew $6 billion, or 19%, over last year to  $38.5 billion, driven by new customer adds as well as continued contribution from  specialty products. Total adjusted scripts were 414 million compared to 399  million in the year ago quarter.  Moving on to 2025 guidance.\nOur adjusted earnings   outlook is at least $16 per share. Revenues will approach  $448 billion, growth of 11% over ‘24.  We now expect a full - year medical care ratio of 89.25 % , plus or minus 25 basis  points. This compares to the initial 86.5 %   mid - point we offered at the end of last  year, with the increase driven by the factors discussed.  Within this, seasonal pacing compared to historical measures is impacted  somewhat by the Part D coverage gap modifications due to the Inflation  Reduction Act. With first half results, at the midpoint that places the second half  at just under 91.5%, with the fourth quarter expected to be the highest and, at  this distance, a relatively proportionate distribution on either side.  The full year outlook contemplates a total of $1.6 billion of potential settlement  items, an incremental $1 billion over the $600 million recognized in the second  quarter.  Our tax rate for the year is now estimated at about 18.5 % , affected by our  revised earnings outlook as expected benefits remain steady, while earnings  declined. The lower tax expense in the second quarter reflects the year - to - date  recognition of the updated full year effective tax rate. We expect the second half  rate to be just over 20 % .  Full year ’25 cash flows from operations are expected to be about $16 billion or  1.1 times net income.  In June, we increased our dividend by 5% and we will strike a balance as to how  we use capital over the near - term, being thoughtful about maintaining a strong  balance sheet and credit rating and mindful of long - standing commitments,  including the pending Amedisys transaction. Our updated share count of 912 to  914 million compares to the original outlook of 918 to 923 million and considers  only share repurchase s   completed earlier this year.\nWe will continue to balance and assess our capital priorities as we progress to  returning to the performance levels we know we can achieve.  With that, I will hand it back over to St ephen   before we head into Q&A.  Ste phen   Hemsley  Thanks, John.  This is a challenging year for our enterprise. But I feel strongly we can overcome  these challenges   –   as we have done before. I can see the depth of the  commitment of our team. We are regaining the intensity, the precision, and the  execution al   disciplines required to perform consistently   and reliably . Our  customers and our shareholders deserve it. And the health system expects us to  function to our full potential.  As we look toward 2026 and beyond, we expect the efforts we discussed  throughout today’s call to steadily improve our performance.   It begins with  respecting pricing basics, advancing our foresight acumen and just better, more  intense,   more decisive   overall management.  We will be driving better business practices, better consumer and provider  experience, and accelerating investment s   in key areas to both strengthen our  foundations and modernize our business es , anchored in practical innovations  and   scaled AI applications.  We are continuing to evaluate the investments we need to make in the near - term  to meet our long - term growth potential while acknowledging the challenging  environment in the year ahead.  As I mentioned at our shareholder meeting in June, we are rebuilding   the   trust  through both change and through increased transparency. That includes work to  ensure a wide range of stakeholders have confidence in the integrity of our  Company and our business practices.   This work is moving forward   in   our  assessment of key policies, practices and associated processes by the end of\nthe third quarter and our first performance measures report in the fourth quarter.  We have retained independent experts to oversee and assist in these reviews,  including the Analysis Group and FTI Consulting. We will use this to continually  strengthen and advance our strong compliance environment.  Looking to 2026, at this distance I would expect   solid but   moderate earnings  growth. As we look further ahead, we see our earnings growth outlook  strengthening quickly in 2027 and pacing steadily upward over the succeeding  years.\n\n[UNH-Q2-2025-Remarks.pdf]\nEarnings Conference Call  Second   Quarter   202 5   Remarks  July 29 , 202 5  Moderator:  Good morning,   and w elcome to the UnitedHealth Group   Second   Quarter   20 2 5  Earnings Conference Call.

I   will   now turn the  conference over to the   chairman and   chief executive officer of UnitedHealth  Group,   Stephen Hemsley .  Ste phen   Hemsley  Thank you.   Good morning   a nd t hank you for joining. Today our prepared remarks  will be a little longer than usual   so we will be allowing more time for your  questions.  As we begin, I want to recognize   our employees who have been so dedicated to  serving our patients, consumers and customers during a prolonged, challenging  period for our business. And I’d like to thank our leadership team, many of whom  are new in their roles, for their willingness to join me in looking hard at our\nbusinesses, getting a grounded assessment of our action plans, re - baselining our  outlook and moving apace to advance the performance of each of our  businesses.  This morning, I know you are eager to get into the underlying details of our  revised financial outlook, which we will do. But at this moment, I believe it ’s   also  important to convey the tone we are setting at this enterprise.  More than anything, it is a tone of change and reform born out of a recommitment  to our mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system  work better for everyone. It ’s   a mission that requires a commitment to a culture of  values, of service, responsibility, integrity and humility.  We pair that mission - driven ambition of reform with a keen sense of the  opportunity and the expectation to perform better than we ever have. As we  continue to assess the state of our businesses, it is very apparent that some  require a fundamental reorientation, others require building and nurturing, and  others must be   re considered and   re directed to original purpose. We also  recognize the need and the opportunity to revisit and address critical processes  and fundamental business practices, both internal and market - facing. We are  acutely aware we have an enormous responsibility for providing care   for   million s  of   people and for protecting the government and private programs we partner in.  As such we have embarked on a real cultural shift in our relationships with  regulators and all external stakeholders. We intend to be proactively engaged,  constructive and responsive to the concerns of all stakeholders and in our  engagement with them.  We have the chance to reposition our enterprise as a far more modern, reliable,  consumer and provider friendly enterprise using new technologies and  approaches, and we are going to pursue that course.  Pursuit of these opportunities aligns to and enables our reform and change  mandate and allows us to better achieve our mission and to steadily perform  better in doing so.\nWe are on this course against a challenging environment which includes:  •   A generational pullback in Medicare funding, set in motion in 2023 and  playing out through 2026.  •   Unprecedented medical cost trend , measured in both intensity of services  used as well as unit prices and more aggressive care provider coding and  billing technologies.  •   The prospects for further contraction of the Medicaid and Exchange  markets.  •   The growing need to invest in the opportunities new technologies offer and  the expectation of all health care entities to offer a better experience for  consumers, customers, care providers and employees.  •   And finally, the continuing public controversy over long - standing practices  and complexities across the entire health care sector,   particularly  managed care , which bears the critical roles for coverage, for care  management and for pricing for the intensity and the cost of services used  into the benefit products and programs for the entire health care market.  As a leading provider of health services, we must help advance a better  health system.  We are committed to engaging in these pursuits with a sense of purpose and  better partnership with all stakeholders, transparency in our business and  reporting practices and continued integrity in all we do.  Beyond the environmental factors that are affecting the entire sector and more  specifically to us, we have made pricing and operational mistakes a s   well as  others . They are getting the needed attention.   Our critical processes, including  risk status, care management, pharmaceutical services and others are being  reviewed by independent experts and they will be reviewed every year and  reported on. And these processes can be reviewed at any time by outside  stakeholders. While we believe in   our   oversight and the integrity of these  processes, wherever they are determined to be at variance with prescribed  practice, they will be promptly remediated and we ’ ll continue on this path.\nAll the foregoing   is   fully addressable. We can steadily restore our performance to  levels consistent with our mission and stakeholder expectations   –   all as we  strengthen an institutional culture aligned to that mission   and accountable for  performance  Over the last 60 days or more, we have made extensive management and  operational changes aligned to this agenda of reform and performance. Other  such changes   –  •   to   leadership,  •   to our businesses, our culture, approaches and practices,  •   and to our board, governance and succession oversight, as appropriate,  •   will continue to be made as we proceed through this period.  With those thoughts in mind, Tim Noel and Patrick Conway, heads of  UnitedHealthcare and Optum respectively, will walk through some of the  specifics in their businesses. John Rex will discuss financial performance and the  elements affecting our outlook.   A nd   I’ll come back with some closing thoughts,  and then we will have ample time for questions and answers.   Tim.  Tim Noel  Thanks, Ste phen .  I want to start by emphasizing that we are approaching our business with greater  humility, greater transparency, and a renewed determination to meet your  expectations and our standards.  The primary driver of the UnitedHealthcare earnings shortfall for 2025 is that our  pricing assumptions were well - short of actual medical costs.   Our current view for  2025 reflects $6.5   billion   more in medical costs than we anticipated in our initial  outlook.\nA little over half, or $3.6   billion ,   of this is in our broad - based Medicare portfolio.  About one - third, or $2.3   billion , is in the commercial business, split evenly  between ACA plans and our employer business. The remaining trend pressure is  related to Medicaid, most notably due to elevated behavioral trend.  In addition to trend - driven issues, the updated 2025 outlook removes about $1  billion from previously planned portfolio actions that we are no longer pursuing.  It also reflects about $850   million   of other items including unfavorable prior period  items   –   primarily from 2024   –   and recognition of several one - time settlements.  We know these are serious challenges.   We are humbled by them and will carry  that sense of humility more deeply into our culture.   But we also believe we can  resolve our current issues and recapture our earnings growth potential.  Let me now provide an update on   where each business stands,   starting with  Medicare .  When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half  of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did  not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are  now experiencing. This was compounded by the magnitude of plan exits across  the sector and the extent to which we now see care providers placing further  service intensity into the health system.   The increasingly flexible orientation to  which our Medicare networks and plan designs have evolved over recent years  left us less able to address these trends in - year.  On trend specifically, the increase in care activity across Individual and Group  Medicare Advantage we saw earlier this year has now affected   complex  populations and our Medicare Supplement business as well.  Across Medicare Advantage, physician and outpatient care together represent  70 %   of the pressure year to date; however, inpatient utilization has accelerated  through Q2 and we expect will comprise a relatively larger portion of the pressure  over the full year.\nWe continue to see utilization increases in ER and observation stays, and  consistently see more services being offered and bundled as part of each ER  visit and clinical encounter.  In short: most encounters are intensifying in services and costing more. Th e  higher trend is broad - based geographically and across our membership,  including our large retained membership base.  To put this into context, we had initially assumed Medicare Advantage medical  cost trend of just over 5 %   when configuring our 2025 bids, in line with our  no...\n\n\nPlease analyze according to the system prompt above.",

I   will   now turn the  conference over to the   chairman and   chief executive officer of UnitedHealth  Group,   Stephen Hemsley .  Ste phen   Hemsley  Thank you.   Good morning   a nd t hank you for joining. Today our prepared remarks  will be a little longer than usual   so we will be allowing more time for your  questions.  As we begin, I want to recognize   our employees who have been so dedicated to  serving our patients, consumers and customers during a prolonged, challenging  period for our business. And I’d like to thank our leadership team, many of whom  are new in their roles, for their willingness to join me in looking hard at our\nbusinesses, getting a grounded assessment of our action plans, re - baselining our  outlook and moving apace to advance the performance of each of our  businesses.  This morning, I know you are eager to get into the underlying details of our  revised financial outlook, which we will do. But at this moment, I believe it ’s   also  important to convey the tone we are setting at this enterprise.  More than anything, it is a tone of change and reform born out of a recommitment  to our mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system  work better for everyone. It ’s   a mission that requires a commitment to a culture of  values, of service, responsibility, integrity and humility.  We pair that mission - driven ambition of reform with a keen sense of the  opportunity and the expectation to perform better than we ever have. As we  continue to assess the state of our businesses, it is very apparent that some  require a fundamental reorientation, others require building and nurturing, and  others must be   re considered and   re directed to original purpose. We also  recognize the need and the opportunity to revisit and address critical processes  and fundamental business practices, both internal and market - facing. We are  acutely aware we have an enormous responsibility for providing care   for   million s  of   people and for protecting the government and private programs we partner in.  As such we have embarked on a real cultural shift in our relationships with  regulators and all external stakeholders. We intend to be proactively engaged,  constructive and responsive to the concerns of all stakeholders and in our  engagement with them.  We have the chance to reposition our enterprise as a far more modern, reliable,  consumer and provider friendly enterprise using new technologies and  approaches, and we are going to pursue that course.  Pursuit of these opportunities aligns to and enables our reform and change  mandate and allows us to better achieve our mission and to steadily perform  better in doing so.\nWe are on this course against a challenging environment which includes:  •   A generational pullback in Medicare funding, set in motion in 2023 and  playing out through 2026.  •   Unprecedented medical cost trend , measured in both intensity of services  used as well as unit prices and more aggressive care provider coding and  billing technologies.  •   The prospects for further contraction of the Medicaid and Exchange  markets.  •   The growing need to invest in the opportunities new technologies offer and  the expectation of all health care entities to offer a better experience for  consumers, customers, care providers and employees.  •   And finally, the continuing public controversy over long - standing practices  and complexities across the entire health care sector,   particularly  managed care , which bears the critical roles for coverage, for care  management and for pricing for the intensity and the cost of services used  into the benefit products and programs for the entire health care market.  As a leading provider of health services, we must help advance a better  health system.  We are committed to engaging in these pursuits with a sense of purpose and  better partnership with all stakeholders, transparency in our business and  reporting practices and continued integrity in all we do.  Beyond the environmental factors that are affecting the entire sector and more  specifically to us, we have made pricing and operational mistakes a s   well as  others . They are getting the needed attention.   Our critical processes, including  risk status, care management, pharmaceutical services and others are being  reviewed by independent experts and they will be reviewed every year and  reported on. And these processes can be reviewed at any time by outside  stakeholders. While we believe in   our   oversight and the integrity of these  processes, wherever they are determined to be at variance with prescribed  practice, they will be promptly remediated and we ’ ll continue on this path.\nAll the foregoing   is   fully addressable. We can steadily restore our performance to  levels consistent with our mission and stakeholder expectations   –   all as we  strengthen an institutional culture aligned to that mission   and accountable for  performance  Over the last 60 days or more, we have made extensive management and  operational changes aligned to this agenda of reform and performance. Other  such changes   –  •   to   leadership,  •   to our businesses, our culture, approaches and practices,  •   and to our board, governance and succession oversight, as appropriate,  •   will continue to be made as we proceed through this period.  With those thoughts in mind, Tim Noel and Patrick Conway, heads of  UnitedHealthcare and Optum respectively, will walk through some of the  specifics in their businesses. John Rex will discuss financial performance and the  elements affecting our outlook.   A nd   I’ll come back with some closing thoughts,  and then we will have ample time for questions and answers.   Tim.  Tim Noel  Thanks, Ste phen .  I want to start by emphasizing that we are approaching our business with greater  humility, greater transparency, and a renewed determination to meet your  expectations and our standards.  The primary driver of the UnitedHealthcare earnings shortfall for 2025 is that our  pricing assumptions were well - short of actual medical costs.   Our current view for  2025 reflects $6.5   billion   more in medical costs than we anticipated in our initial  outlook.\nA little over half, or $3.6   billion ,   of this is in our broad - based Medicare portfolio.  About one - third, or $2.3   billion , is in the commercial business, split evenly  between ACA plans and our employer business. The remaining trend pressure is  related to Medicaid, most notably due to elevated behavioral trend.  In addition to trend - driven issues, the updated 2025 outlook removes about $1  billion from previously planned portfolio actions that we are no longer pursuing.  It also reflects about $850   million   of other items including unfavorable prior period  items   –   primarily from 2024   –   and recognition of several one - time settlements.  We know these are serious challenges.   We are humbled by them and will carry  that sense of humility more deeply into our culture.   But we also believe we can  resolve our current issues and recapture our earnings growth potential.  Let me now provide an update on   where each business stands,   starting with  Medicare .  When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half  of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did  not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are  now experiencing. This was compounded by the magnitude of plan exits across  the sector and the extent to which we now see care providers placing further  service intensity into the health system.   The increasingly flexible orientation to  which our Medicare networks and plan designs have evolved over recent years  left us less able to address these trends in - year.  On trend specifically, the increase in care activity across Individual and Group  Medicare Advantage we saw earlier this year has now affected   complex  populations and our Medicare Supplement business as well.  Across Medicare Advantage, physician and outpatient care together represent  70 %   of the pressure year to date; however, inpatient utilization has accelerated  through Q2 and we expect will comprise a relatively larger portion of the pressure  over the full year.\nWe continue to see utilization increases in ER and observation stays, and  consistently see more services being offered and bundled as part of each ER  visit and clinical encounter.  In short: most encounters are intensifying in services and costing more. Th e  higher trend is broad - based geographically and across our membership,  including our large retained membership base.  To put this into context, we had initially assumed Medicare Advantage medical  cost trend of just over 5 %   when configuring our 2025 bids, in line with our  normalized trend experience in 2024. We now expect full year 2025 trend to be  approximately 7.5 % .  Medicare Supplement, which typically is representative of overall care activity  levels and cost trends in Medicare fee for service broadly, is up similarly in 2025  compared to historical levels. We expect that trend to be over 11% this year vs. 8  to 9% in recent years   --   further confirming the broad - based nature of the care  activity,   and   the coding and billing patterns trends we are seeing.  On Commercial :   We are seeing higher - than - expected medical cost increases,  particularly in outpatient care and, although to a lesser extent, inpatient care.  Orthopedic spending and pharmacy infusions are notable factors here. In the  ACA business, the revenue impact resulting from a difference between the  morbidity that we priced for and what we experienced is the primary cause of our  underperformance.  One example of the elevated Commercial trend is group fully - insured.   There,  trend is approaching 11%, which is approximately 100bps higher than our initial  expectations.  Moving to Medicaid …Similar elevated trends are apparent and are further  affected by increasing and unanticipated acceleration of costs in behavioral  health, where trend is running at 20 % , as well as in pharmacy and home health.\nWe anticipate the existing rate and acuity mismatch will extend well into next  year.  Beyond these segment - specific factors, there are other broad drivers of higher  medical costs. There has been a marked increase in health care costs due in  part to increases in service intensity per encounter. For example, in Medicare  Advantage, higher frequency of physician rounding, testing and related services  of specialists and in ER settings are contributing to elevated outpatient spend.  In addition to strongly responsive pricing for 2026, which I will speak to in a  moment, we are intensifying our remediation actions.  We have stepped up our audit, clinical policy and payment integrity tools to  protect customers and patients from unnecessary costs. These efforts ensure  care is delivered in appropriate settings and grounded in safety and quality while  also identifying waste and abuse in outlier coding and billing practices. We are  shifting to narrower networks and focusing on more disciplined managed  products, particularly in Medicare Advantage. And we have scaled our AI efforts  across health plan operations, which improves the patient and provider service  experiences while driving cost savings.  Lastly, in Medicaid , we continue to actively engage with state partners, using  both past experience and data - driven insights to show the need for immediate  and more regular rate updates.  Taken together, this work is helping restore our operational muscle and  reclaiming executional rigor, helped by modern tools and driven by relentless  focus on improvement.  Turning now to 2026 …Our pricing strategy is intensely focused on margin  recovery and moving back toward our earnings growth targets.  In Medicare , we have historically targeted an operating margin range of 3 to 5 %   .  Now, with the changes from the Inflation Reduction Act on the Part D program,\nwhich resulted in higher revenue, but do not impact earnings, the equivalent  target margin range is in the 2 to 4 %   range.  We are working intensively to remediate Medicare through pricing, product  design and benefit changes that will enable us to be within the lower half of the  targeted margin ranges in 2026, and advancing further in 2027.  Our Medicare Advantage pricing strategy for 2026 assumes a trend approaching  10 % , compared to our current 7.5 %   trend expectation. This accounts for trend  acceleration and incorporates factors such as changes in fee schedules and the  continuation of higher yields from provider coding and billing practices.  Considering the continued cost trend and funding pressures, and the need to  support margin recovery, we have made significant adjustments to benefits.  Additionally   –   and unfortunately   –   given these pressures we have made the  difficult decision to exit plans that currently serve over 600,000 members,  primarily in less managed products such as PPO offerings. We have taken  similar approaches for Medicare Supplement, Group MA, and standalone Part D  pricing for next year. We will be watching the market closely as the 2026  Medicare offerings become public so we can better assess our market  positioning and respond quickly.  For Commercial , because renewals occur over the course of the year, we are  able to price for changes more dynamically.   Our pricing will anticipate high er  trend continuing into 2026 and 2027.   We expect increased membership decline,  as well as shifts into both level - funded and self - funded product categories,  because of higher medical cost trends.  In the individual exchange business, while we are prepared to continue to  participate in the majority of the 30 markets we currently serve, we will approach  them far more conservatively for 2026. We may need to make the difficult  decision to exit select markets if we are unable to achieve the rates necessary for  higher market - wide morbidity. Additionally, due to the projected expiration of  premium subsidies across the ACA market our membership should decline\nsignificantly and we are mindful of the potential for adverse selection dynamics  as we re - price these offerings for next year.  In Medicaid , there remains a lag between funding levels and member health risk  and we expect this to continue into 2026, resulting in additional margin  compression in th e   business including a loss within the non - dual segment of  Medicaid in 2026.   Membership losses from early adoption of recent legislation is  also factored into our initial views for 2026. Wherever states support responsible  funding for Medicaid, we remain committed to serving people through that  program and view this as integral to our mission.  The American health system’s long - standing cost problem is accelerating. We  are embracing our responsibility to continue to drive better health outcomes while  trying to keep health care affordable for all Americans.  The operational and pricing strategies I have described reflect our understanding  of the challenges we face as a company and a society, and our dedication to  responsibly navigating the current financial pressures so that we can set a stable  course for the future.  I’ll now turn it over to Patrick Conway, CEO of Optum.  Patrick Conway  Thanks ,   Tim.  Clearly, Optum’s performance this year has also not met expectations   –   yours or  ours. Echoing Tim and Steve, we are approaching this with humility and the need  for deep analysis of key issues, and commitment to substantially improved  execution. Serving our patients and customers is at the heart of our mission and  business and we have the opportunity to truly help make the health system better  for everyone.\nTo do that, we need to refocus on our performance discipline with a bias for  action and transparency for all stakeholders.  We have launched our agenda of change at Optum, starting with the evolution of  our leadership team.   Roger Connor brings tremendous experience in  organizational execution as our chief financial officer. Krista Nelson is a deeply  experienced health care operator now in the new role of chief operating officer of  Optum Health. Dhivya Suryadevara is already reenergizing product development,  marketing and service as the new CEO of Optum Insight. And Jon Mahrt brings  his unmatched pharmacy services experience to bolster the already compelling  offerings of Optum Rx.  These are not the only people in new roles and there will be more. We are taking  these and many other steps swiftly to enable Optum to recapture its historic  momentum.  Let me turn now to a review of our businesses, starting with Optum Health   –  where improved execution is needed most and where we are experiencing the  greatest pressures to our business.  Our belief remains steadfast: value - based care has the potential to transform  health   care. Yet even as we struggle to align this model with new funding  dynamics, it consistently delivers better outcomes. Tim highlighted the  challenges of rising health care unit costs, accelerating service volumes and  provider coding intensity, which further underscores that value - based care  remains the most effective method for compensating providers to improve and  sustain a patient’s health in contrast to simply increasing the volume and prices  of services.  Research consistently supports this premise, showing Medicare Advantage  patients in fully accountable arrangements are 20% less likely to be hospitalized  and experience 11% fewer ER visits compared to those in fee - for - service. We  are early in our value - based care journey. We know we have real and self -\ninflicted executional challenges and we bear the responsibility to get this right,  recognizing that urgent work lies ahead.  We have spent a decade assembling a care delivery model today serving nearly  20 million patients across three lines of business   –   value - based care, fee - for -  service care delivery and services, the latter two of which help further enable  value - based care.  The first category, value - based care, has grown to account for approximately  65% of Optum Health’s revenues   and serves 5 million patients in fully  accountable arrangements. I’ll provide more details on this in a moment but first  will detail the gap to our original Optum Health outlook.  Overall, Optum Health earnings in 2025 are approximately $6.6   billion   below our  expectations. To break this down:  •   Approximately $3.6   billion , or 55%, is concentrated in our value - based  care business with three principal drivers of roughly equal weight:  o   1 :   The mix of enrollment, including more complex and dually eligible  members, and more new - to - Optum patients who were  underserved;  o   2 :   Accelerated medical trend, particularly physician and outpatient  in Medicare and behavioral in Medicaid.  o   And   3 :   Under - estimation of new members’ risk status as they come  into our care and sub - optimal execution of the V28 risk model  transition;  •   Second category   -   Another $2   billion , or 30%, relates to the decision to  discontinue previously planned portfolio actions.  •   And about $1   billion , or 15%, is from a combination of lower service  volumes in our services businesses, some non - recurring prior period  impacts and the slowing of tuck - in acquisitions. For example, on lower  service volumes, in 2025 we planned for   approximately   20 million fee - for -\nservice visits in our care delivery clinics and we are tracking 19 million  visits, or 5% below this expecta tion Let me dive a bit deeper specifically  into factors affecting our value - based care business:  •   First, V28. This industry - wide shift is effectively a price reduction that we  now estimate created an $11   bill ion   headwind over three years for Optum  Health, with ~$7   billion   that will be realized through 2025. That is $2 billion  and $1 billion, respectively, more than our initial estimates while we also  overestimated the impact and mis - executed the planned efforts to offset  the V28 funding cuts.  •   Second, enrollment mix. Consistent with Q1, in 2025 we have an  unanticipated number of new - to - Optum Health patients who were  previously underserved. These new patients are largely in markets where  numerous plan exits occurred. They include complex patients who require  time to be managed effectively by us. This mix impact implies negative  margins near double - digits for these new patients, which will improve  meaningfully in 2026.  •   Lastly, the elevated medical trend we recognized in the second quarter  was exacerbated by insufficient pricing within United Healthcare and other  payer partners pulling through in the form of insufficient capitation rates for  Optum.  Despite these headwinds, Optum ’s fully accountable value - based care business  is delivering an operating margin of about 1% in 2025. This compares to full year  operating margins of over 3% in 2024 and nearly 5% in 2023.  A large part of the mis - execution in addressing the V28 funding cuts was due to a  non - standardized and overly localized management approach which we are  addressing with urgency. We are driving to a consistent and much more  concentrated regional operating model with four market leaders. We are  evaluating our position in each market. We will shift risk back to the original  underwriters until we have the hardened capacity to navigate it under value -\nbased   constructs.  And Optum will be much more disciplined in taking risk arrangements in product  designs and constructs that allow value - based care to have its intended impact.  Th e   margin compression reflects significant growth in new membership cohorts   –  with nearly 40% of the patients served today having come in since the beginning  of 2024. It also reflects the pull - through from   Medicare Advantage pricing  dislocation Tim described, and the V28 payment cuts.  Regarding patient cohorts: in our value - based care practices, margins improve  the longer patients remain. Our most mature value - based care cohorts   –   those  from 2021 and prior   –   are operating at an estimated 8%+ margin in 2025.   Those  in   2022   and   2023 cohorts are operating at a 2% margin; the 2024 through 2025  groups are at negative margins.  Strong physician engagement, appropriate medical diagnosis, and improved,  consistent quality of care continues to drive year over year improvement in a  cohort’s financial performance and in their health. But it ’ s taking too long and  there is too much variability in results among practices, and we are actively  addressing those factors.  That’s the overall picture of what is happening. I’ll turn now to remediation. Our  plan for improvement has four key elements:  First and foremost, we are improving the implementation and consistency of our  clinical model, which is anchored in primary care and supported by wraparound  services that continue to outperform on quality and cost.  Second, we are committed to margin recovery in value - based care.   We’ve  aligned our 2026 benefits and product portfolio and footprint with our payor  partners to address the final year of V28 headwinds. We plan to cease  arrangements for about 200,000 patients largely in fully accountable PPO\nproducts, representing approximately 40% of the PPO patients we serve today.  We expect to keep narrowing our exposure beyond 2026.  We are increasing rates to reflect the higher risk profiles and acuity we are  seeing and expect to continue. We believe the combination of these activities will  mitigate about half of the remaining $4 billion V28 headwind in 2026.   The  remainder of our offset will come from operating cost discipline and consistent  execution of our care programs which enhance engagement, diagnosis accuracy  and quality outcomes, and reduce overall cost of care.  With 2026 being the final year of   V 28 phase - in, you should expect 2026 value -  based care margins to remain relatively consistent with the 1% margin we are  achieving this year, and then begin to advance again in 2027 and beyond.  We are optimizing our portfolio of clinical practices. We are managing our fee - for -  service and fully accountable risk practices to align with performance  expectations, transitioning to partial risk or service arrangements where  necessary, and exiting fully accountable products in certain markets.  Third, we are aggressively advancing operational disciplines across our portfolio  of businesses. The more concentrated operating model I mentioned earlier plays  into more standardized approaches, predictable outcomes and lower operating  costs. We will complete the final stages of our technology integration, which will  enable meaningful advances with emerging technologies like AI to drive  efficiency gains. For 2026 we expect to deliver almost $1   billion   in cost  reductions.  Finally, beyond value - based care, Optum Health also includes fee - for - service  care delivery, including home care, ambulatory surgical care and medical  practices that are not yet fully accountable but support value - based care.   These  together account for 15% of Optum Health’s revenues. Most of these businesses  are performing well and operate at low double - digit margins. However, the  primary care and multi - specialty medical practices that are not yet fully  accountable are running at   negative margins   –   generating hundreds of millions of\nlosses this year alone   –   placing the overall fee - for - service care delivery business  in the mid - single digit margin range.  So, we are actively working to improve payment yields and productivity while  growing these high - value services and fee - for - service margins. We are targeting  growth for these services which are projected to deliver strong year - over - year  earnings growth in 2026.  The third component of Optum Health   –   services   –   is comprised of businesses  including managed behavioral health, military and veterans and health financial  services. These account for about 20% of Optum Health revenues and combined  have   an   almost 10% operating margins.  Overall at Optum Health, while we expect continued pressure for the rest of this  year, we anticipate meaningful improvement in our operations and with earnings  growth in 2026, albeit with a longer path to recovery in our value - based care  business. We now see Optum Health long - term margins in the 6 - 8% range, and  at about 5% for value - based care specifically, as we see significant growth  opportunity for the decade to come.   The overall blended margin will reflect the  early year investment losses generated by new cohorts.   Optum Health is early in  its development and mis - execution is a clear setback, but the long - term growth  potential and expectations remain intact   and significant .  Moving to Optum Insight   –   there is a great need and appetite for technology and  data products to help the health system perform more efficiently and effectively  yet Optum Insight has not fully capitalized on this opportunity. That’s largely due  to an unfocused suite of products, lagging innovation, and longer than expected  impact from last year’s cyberattack, which, unfortunately, came at the expense of  being able to drill down on business innovation, operations and growth.  But as I mentioned earlier, we have a talented team in place now and continue to  recruit talent to develop the next generation of products rooted in AI.\nAs it relates specifically to 2025, we are adjusting our outlook downward by $1  billion .   About half of this is due to a more gradual recovery than initially expected  in some of our volume - based businesses due to Change Healthcare and one -  time cyber - related expenses.  The other half is due to pausing previously planned portfolio actions so that we  can prioritize growth and innovation across our broader portfolio.  At Optum Rx, client retention remains high and consistent with past years. We  expect revenue growth of $18 billion, or 13%, and earnings growth of just over  $200   million , or nearly 4%, driven by low - margin specialty drugs.  Compared to the strong revenue growth rate, our earnings growth has been  constrained by four main factors: the removal of portfolio actions from our plan is  a roughly $150   million   headwind; another $50   million   is from a couple of   ancillary  businesses, where we are taking aggressive corrective actions and adjusting  plans; and the impact of the initial launch phase of our private label business,  Nuvaila,   is   a roughly $150   million   headwind. As it matures, we see Nuvaila  delivering affordability for clients and consumers and strong earnings for Optum  Rx.  Additionally, GLP1s, wh ich can benefit ap propriate patients , continue to impact  earnings, representing a $160   million   headwind for our pharmacy business.  After three months in this role, I want to thank the thousands of people serving in  Optum, and to let external stakeholders know that the problems are fixable, and  that Optum will continue to drive long - term growth and make the most of our  opportunity to serve people.  I’ll turn it over to our president and chief financial officer, John Rex  John?  John Rex  Thanks, Patrick.\nI’ll first walk through second quarter results, then provide some color around the  underlying assumptions within our re - established `25 outlook.  Starting with the second quarter, UnitedHealth Group reported revenues of  nearly $112 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year, which reflected growth  across UnitedHealthcare and Optum.  Adjusted earnings per share of $4.08 was below the same period last year. This  was due primarily to the pricing and medical cost trend factors at  UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health. Included is about $1.2 billion in discrete  items. A little over half reflects the recognition of unfavorable impacts to our ACA  exchange offerings, which I will describe later in more detail. The remainder is  the settlement of several outstanding items which have been in dispute or for  which collection has recently become questionable. Most of these items arise  from prior years. The full year ‘25 outlook we’ve offered today accommodates   $1  billion   in additional potential such items that we may seek to resolve in - year.  Now on to business overviews.  At UnitedHealthcare, second quarter revenues grew by over $12 billion to $86.1  billion, while operating earnings declined by $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion primarily  due to the medical trend factors Tim discussed.  Within our Medicare businesses, year - to - date Medicare Advantage growth is  650,000 people, including those who are dually eligible for Medicaid and  Medicare.  As noted, the second quarter results reflect just over $600 million of unfavorable  impacts from our ACA exchange business, which includes acceleration of  anticipated second half losses with the establishment of a premium deficiency  reserve.   This is due to the higher patient morbidity that is pervasive across the  entire exchange market.\nGiven competitive market dynamics, we have less member growth within our  commercial offerings than initially anticipated. ACA exchange drives about one -  third of our reduced commercial risk member growth outlook for 2025, with  group - insured comprising much of the rest.  As outlined earlier, our Medicaid offerings continue to experience pressure from  the lag in state rate updates relative to the health status of the members being  served. Our state partners remain highly engaged in ongoing rate conversations  and we are closely attuned to   the   federal funding changes and the continued  pace of medical cost trends, particularly in behavioral health.  Moving to Optum.  Optum Health revenues were $25.2 billion in the second quarter, a decline of  $1.8 billion from last year. This was driven by the previously noted contract  adjustments and the effects of the Medicare funding reductions. Optum Health  now expects to add 300,000 new value - based care patients this year compared  to the initial 650,000 outlook as it seeks to focus on improving operating  performance. As noted, we‘ve updated our long - term target margin objective for  Optum Health to the 6 to 8   %   range.  Optum Insight had revenues of $4.8 billion, an increase of $285 million or 6%  year over year. We continue to progress on customer recovery following last  year’s cyber event, albeit pacing more slowly than expected and this is a  component of the reduced full year outlook. The contract revenue backlog at the  end of the second quarter was $32.1 billion.  Optum Rx second quarter revenues grew $6 billion, or 19%, over last year to  $38.5 billion, driven by new customer adds as well as continued contribution from  specialty products. Total adjusted scripts were 414 million compared to 399  million in the year ago quarter.  Moving on to 2025 guidance.\nOur adjusted earnings   outlook is at least $16 per share. Revenues will approach  $448 billion, growth of 11% over ‘24.  We now expect a full - year medical care ratio of 89.25 % , plus or minus 25 basis  points. This compares to the initial 86.5 %   mid - point we offered at the end of last  year, with the increase driven by the factors discussed.  Within this, seasonal pacing compared to historical measures is impacted  somewhat by the Part D coverage gap modifications due to the Inflation  Reduction Act. With first half results, at the midpoint that places the second half  at just under 91.5%, with the fourth quarter expected to be the highest and, at  this distance, a relatively proportionate distribution on either side.  The full year outlook contemplates a total of $1.6 billion of potential settlement  items, an incremental $1 billion over the $600 million recognized in the second  quarter.  Our tax rate for the year is now estimated at about 18.5 % , affected by our  revised earnings outlook as expected benefits remain steady, while earnings  declined. The lower tax expense in the second quarter reflects the year - to - date  recognition of the updated full year effective tax rate. We expect the second half  rate to be just over 20 % .  Full year ’25 cash flows from operations are expected to be about $16 billion or  1.1 times net income.  In June, we increased our dividend by 5% and we will strike a balance as to how  we use capital over the near - term, being thoughtful about maintaining a strong  balance sheet and credit rating and mindful of long - standing commitments,  including the pending Amedisys transaction. Our updated share count of 912 to  914 million compares to the original outlook of 918 to 923 million and considers  only share repurchase s   completed earlier this year.\nWe will continue to balance and assess our capital priorities as we progress to  returning to the performance levels we know we can achieve.  With that, I will hand it back over to St ephen   before we head into Q&A.  Ste phen   Hemsley  Thanks, John.  This is a challenging year for our enterprise. But I feel strongly we can overcome  these challenges   –   as we have done before. I can see the depth of the  commitment of our team. We are regaining the intensity, the precision, and the  execution al   disciplines required to perform consistently   and reliably . Our  customers and our shareholders deserve it. And the health system expects us to  function to our full potential.  As we look toward 2026 and beyond, we expect the efforts we discussed  throughout today’s call to steadily improve our performance.   It begins with  respecting pricing basics, advancing our foresight acumen and just better, more  intense,   more decisive   overall management.  We will be driving better business practices, better consumer and provider  experience, and accelerating investment s   in key areas to both strengthen our  foundations and modernize our business es , anchored in practical innovations  and   scaled AI applications.  We are continuing to evaluate the investments we need to make in the near - term  to meet our long - term growth potential while acknowledging the challenging  environment in the year ahead.  As I mentioned at our shareholder meeting in June, we are rebuilding   the   trust  through both change and through increased transparency. That includes work to  ensure a wide range of stakeholders have confidence in the integrity of our  Company and our business practices.   This work is moving forward   in   our  assessment of key policies, practices and associated processes by the end of\nthe third quarter and our first performance measures report in the fourth quarter.  We have retained independent experts to oversee and assist in these reviews,  including the Analysis Group and FTI Consulting. We will use this to continually  strengthen and advance our strong compliance environment.  Looking to 2026, at this distance I would expect   solid but   moderate earnings  growth. As we look further ahead, we see our earnings growth outlook  strengthening quickly in 2027 and pacing steadily upward over the succeeding  years.\n\nPlease analyze according to the system prompt above.",

A question and answer session will follow  UnitedHealth Group’s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being  recorded.  Here is some important introductory information.   This call contains “forward -  looking” statements   under U.S. federal securities laws.   These statements are  subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ  materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of  some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with  t he Securities   and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements  included in our current and periodic filings.  This call will also reference non - GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non -  GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the “Financial &   Earnings Reports ”  section of the Company’s Investor   Relations   page at  www.unitedhealthgroup.com.  Information presented on this call is contained in the Earnings Release we issued  this morning and in our Form 8 - K dated   July 29 , 202 5 , which may be accessed  from the Investor   Relations   page of the Company’s website. I   will   now turn the  conference over to the   chairman and   chief executive officer of UnitedHealth  Group,   Stephen Hemsley .  Ste phen   Hemsley  Thank you.   Good morning   a nd t hank you for joining. Today our prepared remarks  will be a little longer than usual   so we will be allowing more time for your  questions.  As we begin, I want to recognize   our employees who have been so dedicated to  serving our patients, consumers and customers during a prolonged, challenging  period for our business. And I’d like to thank our leadership team, many of whom  are new in their roles, for their willingness to join me in looking hard at our\nbusinesses, getting a grounded assessment of our action plans, re - baselining our  outlook and moving apace to advance the performance of each of our  businesses.  This morning, I know you are eager to get into the underlying details of our  revised financial outlook, which we will do. But at this moment, I believe it ’s   also  important to convey the tone we are setting at this enterprise.  More than anything, it is a tone of change and reform born out of a recommitment  to our mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system  work better for everyone. It ’s   a mission that requires a commitment to a culture of  values, of service, responsibility, integrity and humility.  We pair that mission - driven ambition of reform with a keen sense of the  opportunity and the expectation to perform better than we ever have. As we  continue to assess the state of our businesses, it is very apparent that some  require a fundamental reorientation, others require building and nurturing, and  others must be   re considered and   re directed to original purpose. We also  recognize the need and the opportunity to revisit and address critical processes  and fundamental business practices, both internal and market - facing. We are  acutely aware we have an enormous responsibility for providing care   for   million s  of   people and for protecting the government and private programs we partner in.  As such we have embarked on a real cultural shift in our relationships with  regulators and all external stakeholders. We intend to be proactively engaged,  constructive and responsive to the concerns of all stakeholders and in our  engagement with them.  We have the chance to reposition our enterprise as a far more modern, reliable,  consumer and provider friendly enterprise using new technologies and  approaches, and we are going to pursue that course.  Pursuit of these opportunities aligns to and enables our reform and change  mandate and allows us to better achieve our mission and to steadily perform  better in doing so.\nWe are on this course against a challenging environment which includes:  •   A generational pullback in Medicare funding, set in motion in 2023 and  playing out through 2026.  •   Unprecedented medical cost trend , measured in both intensity of services  used as well as unit prices and more aggressive care provider coding and  billing technologies.  •   The prospects for further contraction of the Medicaid and Exchange  markets.  •   The growing need to invest in the opportunities new technologies offer and  the expectation of all health care entities to offer a better experience for  consumers, customers, care providers and employees.  •   And finally, the continuing public controversy over long - standing practices  and complexities across the entire health care sector,   particularly  managed care , which bears the critical roles for coverage, for care  management and for pricing for the intensity and the cost of services used  into the benefit products and programs for the entire health care market.  As a leading provider of health services, we must help advance a better  health system.  We are committed to engaging in these pursuits with a sense of purpose and  better partnership with all stakeholders, transparency in our business and  reporting practices and continued integrity in all we do.  Beyond the environmental factors that are affecting the entire sector and more  specifically to us, we have made pricing and operational mistakes a s   well as  others . They are getting the needed attention.   Our critical processes, including  risk status, care management, pharmaceutical services and others are being  reviewed by independent experts and they will be reviewed every year and  reported on. And these processes can be reviewed at any time by outside  stakeholders. While we believe in   our   oversight and the integrity of these  processes, wherever they are determined to be at variance with prescribed  practice, they will be promptly remediated and we ’ ll continue on this path.\nAll the foregoing   is   fully addressable. We can steadily restore our performance to  levels consistent with our mission and stakeholder expectations   –   all as we  strengthen an institutional culture aligned to that mission   and accountable for  performance  Over the last 60 days or more, we have made extensive management and  operational changes aligned to this agenda of reform and performance. Other  such changes   –  •   to   leadership,  •   to our businesses, our culture, approaches and practices,  •   and to our board, governance and succession oversight, as appropriate,  •   will continue to be made as we proceed through this period.  With those thoughts in mind, Tim Noel and Patrick Conway, heads of  UnitedHealthcare and Optum respectively, will walk through some of the  specifics in their businesses. John Rex will discuss financial performance and the  elements affecting our outlook.   A nd   I’ll come back with some closing thoughts,  and then we will have ample time for questions and answers.   Tim.  Tim Noel  Thanks, Ste phen .  I want to start by emphasizing that we are approaching our business with greater  humility, greater transparency, and a renewed determination to meet your  expectations and our standards.  The primary driver of the UnitedHealthcare earnings shortfall for 2025 is that our  pricing assumptions were well - short of actual medical costs.   Our current view for  2025 reflects $6.5   billion   more in medical costs than we anticipated in our initial  outlook.\nA little over half, or $3.6   billion ,   of this is in our broad - based Medicare portfolio.  About one - third, or $2.3   billion , is in the commercial business, split evenly  between ACA plans and our employer business. The remaining trend pressure is  related to Medicaid, most notably due to elevated behavioral trend.  In addition to trend - driven issues, the updated 2025 outlook removes about $1  billion from previously planned portfolio actions that we are no longer pursuing.  It also reflects about $850   million   of other items including unfavorable prior period  items   –   primarily from 2024   –   and recognition of several one - time settlements.  We know these are serious challenges.   We are humbled by them and will carry  that sense of humility more deeply into our culture.   But we also believe we can  resolve our current issues and recapture our earnings growth potential.  Let me now provide an update on   where each business stands,   starting with  Medicare .  When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half  of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did  not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are  now experiencing. This was compounded by the magnitude of plan exits across  the sector and the extent to which we now see care providers placing further  service intensity into the health system.   The increasingly flexible orientation to  which our Medicare networks and plan designs have evolved over recent years  left us less able to address these trends in - year.  On trend specifically, the increase in care activity across Individual and Group  Medicare Advantage we saw earlier this year has now affected   complex  populations and our Medicare Supplement business as well.  Across Medicare Advantage, physician and outpatient care together represent  70 %   of the pressure year to date; however, inpatient utilization has accelerated  through Q2 and we expect will comprise a relatively larger portion of the pressure  over the full year.\nWe continue to see utilization increases in ER and observation stays, and  consistently see more services being offered and bundled as part of each ER  visit and clinical encounter.  In short: most encounters are intensifying in services and costing more. Th e  higher trend is broad - based geographically and across our membership,  including our large retained membership base.  To put this into context, we had initially assumed Medicare Advantage medical  cost trend of just over 5 %   when configuring our 2025 bids, in line with our  normalized trend experience in 2024. We now expect full year 2025 trend to be  approximately 7.5 % .  Medicare Supplement, which typically is representative of overall care activity  levels and cost trends in Medicare fee for service broadly, is up similarly in 2025  compared to historical levels. We expect that trend to be over 11% this year vs. 8  to 9% in recent years   --   further confirming the broad - based nature of the care  activity,   and   the coding and billing patterns trends we are seeing.  On Commercial :   We are seeing higher - than - expected medical cost increases,  particularly in outpatient care and, although to a lesser extent, inpatient care.  Orthopedic spending and pharmacy infusions are notable factors here. In the  ACA business, the revenue impact resulting from a difference between the  morbidity that we priced for and what we experienced is the primary cause of our  underperformance.  One example of the elevated Commercial trend is group fully - insured.   There,  trend is approaching 11%, which is approximately 100bps higher than our initial  expectations.  Moving to Medicaid …Similar elevated trends are apparent and are further  affected by increasing and unanticipated acceleration of costs in behavioral  health, where trend is running at 20 % , as well as in pharmacy and home health.\nWe anticipate the existing rate and acuity mismatch will extend well into next  year.  Beyond these segment - specific factors, there are other broad drivers of higher  medical costs. There has been a marked increase in health care costs due in  part to increases in service intensity per encounter. For example, in Medicare  Advantage, higher frequency of physician rounding, testing and related services  of specialists and in ER settings are contributing to elevated outpatient spend.  In addition to strongly responsive pricing for 2026, which I will speak to in a  moment, we are intensifying our remediation actions.  We have stepped up our audit, clinical policy and payment integrity tools to  protect customers and patients from unnecessary costs. These efforts ensure  care is delivered in appropriate settings and grounded in safety and quality while  also identifying waste and abuse in outlier coding and billing practices. We are  shifting to narrower networks and focusing on more disciplined managed  products, particularly in Medicare Advantage. And we have scaled our AI efforts  across health plan operations, which improves the patient and provider service  experiences while driving cost savings.  Lastly, in Medicaid , we continue to actively engage with state partners, using  both past experience and data - driven insights to show the need for immediate  and more regular rate updates.  Taken together, this work is helping restore our operational muscle and  reclaiming executional rigor, helped by modern tools and driven by relentless  focus on improvement.  Turning now to 2026 …Our pricing strategy is intensely focused on margin  recovery and moving back toward our earnings growth targets.  In Medicare , we have historically targeted an operating margin range of 3 to 5 %   .  Now, with the changes from the Inflation Reduction Act on the Part D program,\nwhich resulted in higher revenue, but do not impact earnings, the equivalent  target margin range is in the 2 to 4 %   range.  We are working intensively to remediate Medicare through pricing, product  design and benefit changes that will enable us to be within the lower half of the  targeted margin ranges in 2026, and advancing further in 2027.  Our Medicare Advantage pricing strategy for 2026 assumes a trend approaching  10 % , compared to our current 7.5 %   trend expectation. This accounts for trend  acceleration and incorporates factors such as changes in fee schedules and the  continuation of higher yields from provider coding and billing practices.  Considering the continued cost trend and funding pressures, and the need to  support margin recovery, we have made significant adjustments to benefits.  Additionally   –   and unfortunately   –   given these pressures we have made the  difficult decision to exit plans that currently serve over 600,000 members,  primarily in less managed products such as PPO offerings. We have taken  similar approaches for Medicare Supplement, Group MA, and standalone Part D  pricing for next year. We will be watching the market closely as the 2026  Medicare offerings become public so we can better assess our market  positioning and respond quickly.  For Commercial , because renewals occur over the course of the year, we are  able to price for changes more dynamically.   Our pricing will anticipate high er  trend continuing into 2026 and 2027.   We expect increased membership decline,  as well as shifts into both level - funded and self - funded product categories,  because of higher medical cost trends.  In the individual exchange business, while we are prepared to continue to  participate in the majority of the 30 markets we currently serve, we will approach  them far more conservatively for 2026. We may need to make the difficult  decision to exit select markets if we are unable to achieve the rates necessary for  higher market - wide morbidity. Additionally, due to the projected expiration of  premium subsidies across the ACA market our membership should decline\nsignificantly and we are mindful of the potential for adverse selection dynamics  as we re - price these offerings for next year.  In Medicaid , there remains a lag between funding levels and member health risk  and we expect this to continue into 2026, resulting in additional margin  compression in th e   business including a loss within the non - dual segment of  Medicaid in 2026.   Membership losses from early adoption of recent legislation is  also factored into our initial views for 2026. Wherever states support responsible  funding for Medicaid, we remain committed to serving people through that  program and view this as integral to our mission.  The American health system’s long - standing cost problem is accelerating. We  are embracing our responsibility to continue to drive better health outcomes while  trying to keep health care affordable for all Americans.  The operational and pricing strategies I have described reflect our understanding  of the challenges we face as a company and a society, and our dedication to  responsibly navigating the current financial pressures so that we can set a stable  course for the future.  I’ll now turn it over to Patrick Conway, CEO of Optum.  Patrick Conway  Thanks ,   Tim.  Clearly, Optum’s performance this year has also not met expectations   –   yours or  ours. Echoing Tim and Steve, we are approaching this with humility and the need  for deep analysis of key issues, and commitment to substantially improved  execution. Serving our patients and customers is at the heart of our mission and  business and we have the opportunity to truly help make the health system better  for everyone.\nTo do that, we need to refocus on our performance discipline with a bias for  action and transparency for all stakeholders.  We have launched our agenda of change at Optum, starting with the evolution of  our leadership team.   Roger Connor brings tremendous experience in  organizational execution as our chief financial officer. Krista Nelson is a deeply  experienced health care operator now in the new role of chief operating officer of  Optum Health. Dhivya Suryadevara is already reenergizing product development,  marketing and service as the new CEO of Optum Insight. And Jon Mahrt brings  his unmatched pharmacy services experience to bolster the already compelling  offerings of Optum Rx.  These are not the only people in new roles and there will be more. We are taking  these and many other steps swiftly to enable Optum to recapture its historic  momentum.  Let me turn now to a review of our businesses, starting with Optum Health   –  where improved execution is needed most and where we are experiencing the  greatest pressures to our business.  Our belief remains steadfast: value - based care has the potential to transform  health   care. Yet even as we struggle to align this model with new funding  dynamics, it consistently delivers better outcomes. Tim highlighted the  challenges of rising health care unit costs, accelerating service volumes and  provider coding intensity, which further underscores that value - based care  remains the most effective method for compensating providers to improve and  sustain a patient’s health in contrast to simply increasing the volume and prices  of services.  Research consistently supports this premise, showing Medicare Advantage  patients in fully accountable arrangements are 20% less likely to be hospitalized  and experience 11% fewer ER visits compared to those in fee - for - service. We  are early in our value - based care journey. We know we have real and self -\ninflicted executional challenges and we bear the responsibility to get this right,  recognizing that urgent work lies ahead.  We have spent a decade assembling a care delivery model today serving nearly  20 million patients across three lines of business   –   value - based care, fee - for -  service care delivery and services, the latter two of which help further enable  value - based care.  The first category, value - based care, has grown to account for approximately  65% of Optum Health’s revenues   and serves 5 million patients in fully  accountable arrangements. I’ll provide more details on this in a moment but first  will detail the gap to our original Optum Health outlook.  Overall, Optum Health earnings in 2025 are approximately $6.6   billion   below our  expectations. To break this down:  •   Approximately $3.6   billion , or 55%, is concentrated in our value - based  care business with three principal drivers of roughly equal weight:  o   1 :   The mix of enrollment, including more complex and dually eligible  members, and more new - to - Optum patients who were  underserved;  o   2 :   Accelerated medical trend, particularly physician and outpatient  in Medicare and behavioral in Medicaid.  o   And   3 :   Under - estimation of new members’ risk status as they come  into our care and sub - optimal execution of the V28 risk model  transition;  •   Second category   -   Another $2   billion , or 30%, relates to the decision to  discontinue previously planned portfolio actions.  •   And about $1   billion , or 15%, is from a combination of lower service  volumes in our services businesses, some non - recurring prior period  impacts and the slowing of tuck - in acquisitions. For example, on lower  service volumes, in 2025 we planned for   approximately   20 million fee - for -\nservice visits in our care delivery clinics and we are tracking 19 million  visits, or 5% below this expecta tion Let me dive a bit deeper specifically  into factors affecting our value - based care business:  •   First, V28. This industry - wide shift is effectively a price reduction that we  now estimate created an $11   bill ion   headwind over three years for Optum  Health, with ~$7   billion   that will be realized through 2025. That is $2 billion  and $1 billion, respectively, more than our initial estimates while we also  overestimated the impact and mis - executed the planned efforts to offset  the V28 funding cuts.  •   Second, enrollment mix. Consistent with Q1, in 2025 we have an  unanticipated number of new - to - Optum Health patients who were  previously underserved. These new patients are largely in markets where  numerous plan exits occurred. They include complex patients who require  time to be managed effectively by us. This mix impact implies negative  margins near double - digits for these new patients, which will improve  meaningfully in 2026.  •   Lastly, the elevated medical trend we recognized in the second quarter  was exacerbated by insufficient pricing within United Healthcare and other  payer partners pulling through in the form of insufficient capitation rates for  Optum.  Despite these headwinds, Optum ’s fully accountable value - based care business  is delivering an operating margin of about 1% in 2025. This compares to full year  operating margins of over 3% in 2024 and nearly 5% in 2023.  A large part of the mis - execution in addressing the V28 funding cuts was due to a  non - standardized and overly localized management approach which we are  addressing with urgency. We are driving to a consistent and much more  concentrated regional operating model with four market leaders. We are  evaluating our position in each market. We will shift risk back to the original  underwriters until we have the hardened capacity to navigate it under value -\nbased   constructs.  And Optum will be much more disciplined in taking risk arrangements in product  designs and constructs that allow value - based care to have its intended impact.  Th e   margin compression reflects significant growth in new membership cohorts   –  with nearly 40% of the patients served today having come in since the beginning  of 2024. It also reflects the pull - through from   Medicare Advantage pricing  dislocation Tim described, and the V28 payment cuts.  Regarding patient cohorts: in our value - based care practices, margins improve  the longer patients remain. Our most mature value - based care cohorts   –   those  from 2021 and prior   –   are operating at an estimated 8%+ margin in 2025.   Those  in   2022   and   2023 cohorts are operating at a 2% margin; the 2024 through 2025  groups are at negative margins.  Strong physician engagement, appropriate medical diagnosis, and improved,  consistent quality of care continues to drive year over year improvement in a  cohort’s financial performance and in their health. But it ’ s taking too long and  there is too much variability in results among practices, and we are actively  addressing those factors.  That’s the overall picture of what is happening. I’ll turn now to remediation. Our  plan for improvement has four key elements:  First and foremost, we are improving the implementation and consistency of our  clinical model, which is anchored in primary care and supported by wraparound  services that continue to outperform on quality and cost.  Second, we are committed to margin recovery in value - based care.   We’ve  aligned our 2026 benefits and product portfolio and footprint with our payor  partners to address the final year of V28 headwinds. We plan to cease  arrangements for about 200,000 patients largely in fully accountable PPO\nproducts, representing approximately 40% of the PPO patients we serve today.  We expect to keep narrowing our exposure beyond 2026.  We are increasing rates to reflect the higher risk profiles and acuity we are  seeing and expect to continue. We believe the combination of these activities will  mitigate about half of the remaining $4 billion V28 headwind in 2026.   The  remainder of our offset will come from operating cost discipline and consistent  execution of our care programs which enhance engagement, diagnosis accuracy  and quality outcomes, and reduce overall cost of care.  With 2026 being the final year of   V 28 phase - in, you should expect 2026 value -  based care margins to remain relatively consistent with the 1% margin we are  achieving this year, and then begin to advance again in 2027 and beyond.  We are optimizing our portfolio of clinical practices. We are managing our fee - for -  service and fully accountable risk practices to align with performance  expectations, transitioning to partial risk or service arrangements where  necessary, and exiting fully accountable products in certain markets.  Third, we are aggressively advancing operational disciplines across our portfolio  of businesses. The more concentrated operating model I mentioned earlier plays  into more standardized approaches, predictable outcomes and lower operating  costs. We will complete the final stages of our technology integration, which will  enable meaningful advances with emerging technologies like AI to drive  efficiency gains. For 2026 we expect to deliver almost $1   billion   in cost  reductions.  Finally, beyond value - based care, Optum Health also includes fee - for - service  care delivery, including home care, ambulatory surgical care and medical  practices that are not yet fully accountable but support value - based care.   These  together account for 15% of Optum Health’s revenues. Most of these businesses  are performing well and operate at low double - digit margins. However, the  primary care and multi - specialty medical practices that are not yet fully  accountable are running at   negative margins   –   generating hundreds of millions of\nlosses this year alone   –   placing the overall fee - for - service care delivery business  in the mid - single digit margin range.  So, we are actively working to improve payment yields and productivity while  growing these high - value services and fee - for - service margins. We are targeting  growth for these services which are projected to deliver strong year - over - year  earnings growth in 2026.  The third component of Optum Health   –   services   –   is comprised of businesses  including managed behavioral health, military and veterans and health financial  services. These account for about 20% of Optum Health revenues and combined  have   an   almost 10% operating margins.  Overall at Optum Health, while we expect continued pressure for the rest of this  year, we anticipate meaningful improvement in our operations and with earnings  growth in 2026, albeit with a longer path to recovery in our value - based care  business. We now see Optum Health long - term margins in the 6 - 8% range, and  at about 5% for value - based care specifically, as we see significant growth  opportunity for the decade to come.   The overall blended margin will reflect the  early year investment losses generated by new cohorts.   Optum Health is early in  its development and mis - execution is a clear setback, but the long - term growth  potential and expectations remain intact   and significant .  Moving to Optum Insight   –   there is a great need and appetite for technology and  data products to help the health system perform more efficiently and effectively  yet Optum Insight has not fully capitalized on this opportunity. That’s largely due  to an unfocused suite of products, lagging innovation, and longer than expected  impact from last year’s cyberattack, which, unfortunately, came at the expense of  being able to drill down on business innovation, operations and growth.  But as I mentioned earlier, we have a talented team in place now and continue to  recruit talent to develop the next generation of products rooted in AI.\nAs it relates specifically to 2025, we are adjusting our outlook downward by $1  billion .   About half of this is due to a more gradual recovery than initially expected  in some of our volume - based businesses due to Change Healthcare and one -  time cyber - related expenses.  The other half is due to pausing previously planned portfolio actions so that we  can prioritize growth and innovation across our broader portfolio.  At Optum Rx, client retention remains high and consistent with past years. We  expect revenue growth of $18 billion, or 13%, and earnings growth of just over  $200   million , or nearly 4%, driven by low - margin specialty drugs.  Compared to the strong revenue growth rate, our earnings growth has been  constrained by four main factors: the removal of portfolio actions from our plan is  a roughly $150   million   headwind; another $50   million   is from a couple of   ancillary  businesses, where we are taking aggressive corrective actions and adjusting  plans; and the impact of the initial launch phase of our private label business,  Nuvaila,   is   a roughly $150   million   headwind. As it matures, we see Nuvaila  delivering affordability for clients and consumers and strong earnings for Optum  Rx.  Additionally, GLP1s, wh ich can benefit ap propriate patients , continue to impact  earnings, representing a $160   million   headwind for our pharmacy business.  After three months in this role, I want to thank the thousands of people serving in  Optum, and to let external stakeholders know that the problems are fixable, and  that Optum will continue to drive long - term growth and make the most of our  opportunity to serve people.  I’ll turn it over to our president and chief financial officer, John Rex  John?  John Rex  Thanks, Patrick.\nI’ll first walk through second quarter results, then provide some color around the  underlying assumptions within our re - established `25 outlook.  Starting with the second quarter, UnitedHealth Group reported revenues of  nearly $112 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year, which reflected growth  across UnitedHealthcare and Optum.  Adjusted earnings per share of $4.08 was below the same period last year. This  was due primarily to the pricing and medical cost trend factors at  UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health. Included is about $1.2 billion in discrete  items. A little over half reflects the recognition of unfavorable impacts to our ACA  exchange offerings, which I will describe later in more detail. The remainder is  the settlement of several outstanding items which have been in dispute or for  which collection has recently become questionable. Most of these items arise  from prior years. The full year ‘25 outlook we’ve offered today accommodates   $1  billion   in additional potential such items that we may seek to resolve in - year.  Now on to business overviews.  At UnitedHealthcare, second quarter revenues grew by over $12 billion to $86.1  billion, while operating earnings declined by $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion primarily  due to the medical trend factors Tim discussed.  Within our Medicare businesses, year - to - date Medicare Advantage growth is  650,000 people, including those who are dually eligible for Medicaid and  Medicare.  As noted, the second quarter results reflect just over $600 million of unfavorable  impacts from our ACA exchange business, which includes acceleration of  anticipated second half losses with the establishment of a premium deficiency  reserve.   This is due to the higher patient morbidity that is pervasive across the  entire exchange market.\nGiven competitive market dynamics, we have less member growth within our  commercial offerings than initially anticipated. ACA exchange drives about one -  third of our reduced commercial risk member growth outlook for 2025, with  group - insured comprising much of the rest.  As outlined earlier, our Medicaid offerings continue to experience pressure from  the lag in state rate updates relative to the health status of the members being  served. Our state partners remain highly engaged in ongoing rate conversations  and we are closely attuned to   the   federal funding changes and the continued  pace of medical cost trends, particularly in behavioral health.  Moving to Optum.  Optum Health revenues were $25.2 billion in the second quarter, a decline of  $1.8 billion from last year. This was driven by the previously noted contract  adjustments and the effects of the Medicare funding reductions. Optum Health  now expects to add 300,000 new value - based care patients this year compared  to the initial 650,000 outlook as it seeks to focus on improving operating  performance. As noted, we‘ve updated our long - term target margin objective for  Optum Health to the 6 to 8   %   range.  Optum Insight had revenues of $4.8 billion, an increase of $285 million or 6%  year over year. We continue to progress on customer recovery following last  year’s cyber event, albeit pacing more slowly than expected and this is a  component of the reduced full year outlook. The contract revenue backlog at the  end of the second quarter was $32.1 billion.  Optum Rx second quarter revenues grew $6 billion, or 19%, over last year to  $38.5 billion, driven by new customer adds as well as continued contribution from  specialty products. Total adjusted scripts were 414 million compared to 399  million in the year ago quarter.  Moving on to 2025 guidance.\nOur adjusted earnings   outlook is at least $16 per share. Revenues will approach  $448 billion, growth of 11% over ‘24.  We now expect a full - year medical care ratio of 89.25 % , plus or minus 25 basis  points. This compares to the initial 86.5 %   mid - point we offered at the end of last  year, with the increase driven by the factors discussed.  Within this, seasonal pacing compared to historical measures is impacted  somewhat by the Part D coverage gap modifications due to the Inflation  Reduction Act. With first half results, at the midpoint that places the second half  at just under 91.5%, with the fourth quarter expected to be the highest and, at  this distance, a relatively proportionate distribution on either side.  The full year outlook contemplates a total of $1.6 billion of potential settlement  items, an incremental $1 billion over the $600 million recognized in the second  quarter.  Our tax rate for the year is now estimated at about 18.5 % , affected by our  revised earnings outlook as expected benefits remain steady, while earnings  declined. The lower tax expense in the second quarter reflects the year - to - date  recognition of the updated full year effective tax rate. We expect the second half  rate to be just over 20 % .  Full year ’25 cash flows from operations are expected to be about $16 billion or  1.1 times net income.  In June, we increased our dividend by 5% and we will strike a balance as to how  we use capital over the near - term, being thoughtful about maintaining a strong  balance sheet and credit rating and mindful of long - standing commitments,  including the pending Amedisys transaction. Our updated share count of 912 to  914 million compares to the original outlook of 918 to 923 million and considers  only share repurchase s   completed earlier this year.\nWe will continue to balance and assess our capital priorities as we progress to  returning to the performance levels we know we can achieve.  With that, I will hand it back over to St ephen   before we head into Q&A.  Ste phen   Hemsley  Thanks, John.  This is a challenging year for our enterprise. But I feel strongly we can overcome  these challenges   –   as we have done before. I can see the depth of the  commitment of our team. We are regaining the intensity, the precision, and the  execution al   disciplines required to perform consistently   and reliably . Our  customers and our shareholders deserve it. And the health system expects us to  function to our full potential.  As we look toward 2026 and beyond, we expect the efforts we discussed  throughout today’s call to steadily improve our performance.   It begins with  respecting pricing basics, advancing our foresight acumen and just better, more  intense,   more decisive   overall management.  We will be driving better business practices, better consumer and provider  experience, and accelerating investment s   in key areas to both strengthen our  foundations and modernize our business es , anchored in practical innovations  and   scaled AI applications.  We are continuing to evaluate the investments we need to make in the near - term  to meet our long - term growth potential while acknowledging the challenging  environment in the year ahead.  As I mentioned at our shareholder meeting in June, we are rebuilding   the   trust  through both change and through increased transparency. That includes work to  ensure a wide range of stakeholders have confidence in the integrity of our  Company and our business practices.   This work is moving forward   in   our  assessment of key policies, practices and associated processes by the end of\nthe third quarter and our first performance measures report in the fourth quarter.  We have retained independent experts to oversee and assist in these reviews,  including the Analysis Group and FTI Consulting. We will use this to continually  strengthen and advance our strong compliance environment.  Looking to 2026, at this distance I would expect   solid but   moderate earnings  growth. As we look further ahead, we see our earnings growth outlook  strengthening quickly in 2027 and pacing steadily upward over the succeeding  years.\n\nPlease analyze according to the system prompt above.",
