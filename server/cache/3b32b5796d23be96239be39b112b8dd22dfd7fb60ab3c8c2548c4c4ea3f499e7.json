  "content": "\"Billion\" is a large number that can mean different things depending on the numbering system:\n\n**Short scale (used in US, UK, and most English-speaking countries):**\n- 1 billion = 1,000,000,000 (one thousand million)\n- Written as 10⁹\n\n**Long scale (used in some European countries):**\n- 1 billion = 1,000,000,000,000 (one million million)\n- Written as 10¹²\n\nThe short scale definition is most commonly used today. To put a billion in perspective:\n- A billion seconds is about 31.7 years\n- A billion dollars in $100 bills would weigh about 10 tons\n- If you counted one number per second, it would take you about 31.7 years to count to one billion\n\nIs there something specific about billions you'd like to know more about?",
